To better understand philanthropy\u2019s role in it, we commissioned Benjamin Soskis, whose work we\u2019ve funded via our <a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/history-of-philanthropy\">history of philanthropy</a> project, to produce a <a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/files/History_of_Philanthropy/Misc/Case_Study_Soskis_Marriage_Equality.pdf\">literature review and case study (.pdf)</a>. It covers the history of the campaign to secure marriage equality in the United States, which culminated in the Supreme Court\u2019s decision, in <i>Obergefell v. Hodges</i>, that the U.S. Constitution guarantees same-sex couples the right to marry.</p><p>Here are a few of our takeaways from the report:</p><ul><li>Philanthropic efforts likely played a role in the campaign for marriage equality, but there were also broad cultural trends toward more people being \u201cout\u201d as homosexual, and more people knowing someone who was out, and this likely shifted public opinion substantially. Thus, it\u2019s not clear that this campaign\u2019s \u201cphilanthropy playbook\u201d would be effective if applied to other causes that do not benefit from analogous cultural trends.</li><li>There is mixed evidence with respect to whether philanthropic \u201cinsiders\u201d had correct strategic views:<ul><li>Some strategic decisions made by \u201coutsiders\u201d looked at the time (to insiders) to be reckless and counterproductive. Some of those look like good decisions in retrospect, while others ended up looking counterproductive in the short run, but may (or may not) have been productive in the long run. Some decisions that look good in retrospect may only appear so due to the (potentially) inevitable long-run success of the campaign.</li></ul></li><li>Some of the data-driven messaging analysis pushed by the \u201cinsiders\u201d looks quite successful in retrospect.</li><li>Despite the fact that the ultimate victories were in the Supreme Court, there were some philanthropic contributions that seem highly relevant, particularly funding messaging analysis and ballot initiatives. There are good arguments that legislative and ballot victories played an important role in later Supreme Court decisions, including <i>Obergefell v. Hodges</i>.</li></ul><p><a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/files/History_of_Philanthropy/Misc/Case_Study_Soskis_Marriage_Equality.pdf\">Read the full literature review and case study here (.pdf)</a></p>", "user": {"username": "HoldenKarnofsky"}}, {"_id": "totgYA8mHXaJAhDXE", "title": "The war on animal product alternatives", "postedAt": "2018-08-15T05:00:00.000Z", "htmlBody": "<p>The meat and dairy industries\u2019 war on alternatives to their products is underway.

Some of the industry\u2019s requests seem absurd enough to be rejected.

The FDA is more likely to issue new regulations than to enforce its current <a href=\"https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/CFRSearch.cfm?fr=131.110\"><u>standard of identity</u></a> for milk \u2014 \u201cthe lacteal secretion ... of one or more healthy cows\u201d \u2014 &nbsp;if only because of those last two words: the latest <a href=\"https://www.aphis.usda.gov/animal_health/nahms/dairy/downloads/dairy14/Dairy14_dr_Mastitis.pdf\"><u>USDA survey</u></a> found a quarter of US dairy cows experienced clinical mastitis, a disease of the udder, during 2013, and the milk of these unhealthy cows&nbsp;still <a href=\"http://www.milkfacts.info/Milk%20Microbiology/Mastitis%20and%20SCC.htm\"><u>goes to market</u></a>&nbsp;(unless they receive antibiotics). The USDA might even think twice before requiring the \u201clab produced\u201d labels that industry wants on clean meat; chicken nuggets were likely <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/articles/life/food/2012/12/robert_c_baker_the_man_who_invented_chicken_nuggets.html\"><u>first produced</u></a> in a food science lab too.</p><p>Some of the new regulations are also likely illegal, while others may be irrelevant.

North Carolina\u2019s law is likely preempted by the federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, which <a href=\"https://www.shb.com/~/media/files/professionals/heinzlindsey/dairy-vs-plantbased-milks-a-regulatory-standoff.pdf\"><u>four federal courts</u></a> have already found preempts state lawsuits claiming that plant-based milks are mislabeled.

In Canada, where plant-based milks have never been able to use the term \u201cmilk\u201d, plant-based milk sales have <a href=\"http://www.canadiangrocer.com/categories/dairy-deli-bakery/its-all-in-the-label-73969\"><u>risen</u></a> while dairy milk sales have fallen, just as in the US.</p><p>But there\u2019s also reason to worry.

(The irony is that the USDA only has <a href=\"https://www.fsis.usda.gov/wps/wcm/connect/f4af7c74-2b9f-4484-bb16-fd8f9820012d/Labeling_Requirements_Guide.pdf?MOD=AJPERES\"><u>regulatory authority</u></a> over meat, poultry, and egg products; if it agrees with the lobbyists that clean meat is not meat, the USDA may lose its authority to regulate.) The USDA could keep new products off the market by rejecting them as misbranded, or by requiring endless pre-market safety testing, which could delay product launches for years.</p><p>And even if the FDA keeps primary jurisdiction over clean meat, the current attacks on clean meat could do lasting harm.

Source: PETA.</i></figcaption></figure><h1>What can we do?</h1><p>So what can you do to help stem the assault? The first thing is to tell regulators how you feel. The FDA is accepting comments on \u201cFoods Produced Using Animal Cell Culture Technology\u201d <a href=\"https://www.regulations.gov/docket?D=FDA-2018-N-2155\"><u>here</u></a> through September 25. Opponents are already posting insightful comments like: \u201cIt is my hope that FDA doesn't call this meet [sic]. At best it is a food like product like American cheese.\u201d The FDA will soon also open a comment period on milk labeling \u2014 watch this space.</p><p>Next, you can reach out to legislators. Animal agriculture\u2019s influence is bipartisan: it got Sen. Tammy Baldwin (D-MN) to introduce the <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/senate-bill/130/text\"><u>Dairy Pride Act</u></a>, which would ban the use of dairy terms on products not \u201cobtained by the complete milking of one or more hooved mammals\u201d (the bill\u2019s authors wisely dropped the \u201chealthy cows\u201d requirement in the FDA language). Liberal luminaries Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Chris Murphy (D-CT) have since <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/senate-bill/130/cosponsors\"><u>co-sponsored</u></a> the bill, and all but four Democratic senators <a href=\"https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/115-2018/s177?utm_campaign=govtrack_feed&amp;utm_source=govtrack/feed&amp;utm_medium=rss\"><u>voted against</u></a> the Booker-Lee amendment to stop the FDA\u2019s action. (<a href=\"https://www.feinstein.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2018/8/senators-reject-harmful-king-amendment-to-farm-bill\"><u>29 Democratic Senators</u></a>, including Warren and Murphy, did, however, recently write in opposition to the King Amendment.) Animal advocates need to be equally bipartisan in their lobbying.</p><p>It may also be worth reaching out to agribusinesses with a stake in this fight. Last year <a href=\"https://www.cargill.com/story/protein-innovation-cargill-invests-in-cultured-meats\"><u>Cargill</u></a> and <a href=\"https://www.tysonfoods.com/who-we-are/the-feed/why-we-are-investing-alternative-proteins\"><u>Tyson Foods</u></a> made high-profile investments in clean meat startup Memphis Meats. Other agribusinesses have larger stakes in alternative proteins: meat giant <a href=\"http://vegangazette.com/meat-company-acquires-vegan-brand-field-roast-120m/\"><u>Maple Leaf Foods</u></a> owns Field Roast and Lightlife; dairy giant <a href=\"https://www.foodprocessing.com/industrynews/2016/danone-to-acquire-whitewave/\"><u>Danone</u></a> owns Silk, So Delicious, and Vega; Kellogg owns Morningstar Farms and Gardenburger; and ConAgra is about to <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-pinnacle-fds-m-a-conagra-brands/conagra-to-buy-pinnacle-for-8-1-billion-creating-frozen-food-powerhouse-idUSKBN1JN19Y\"><u>buy</u></a> the owner of Gardein. Even animal feed giants like Archers Daniels Midland, DowDupont, and Roquette have <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-crops-protein/big-ag-turns-to-peas-to-meet-soaring-global-protein-demand-idUSKCN1IJ1B3\"><u>invested</u></a> in pea protein production. So far these agribusinesses have been silent in this fight \u2014 perhaps because alternatives remain a fraction of their total businesses, or because they fear offending their farmers.

If the giver doesn&#x27;t expect to learn anything over time about the best places to give, the question of when to give boils down roughly to the question of whether the interest rate at which they could invest exceeds the &quot;charitable discount rate&quot; at which doing a unit of good is growing more costly.</p><p>For me, and I think for pretty much any (utilitarian-leaning) aspiring effective altruist right now, the &quot;learning&quot; consideration should swamp all else. We currently lack, as far as I can tell, any good way to forecast the long-run impacts of our actions, and in that lack I think all of our attempts at charity are about as likely to do harm as to do good. But more people are starting to think about the problem seriously, and there is at least a sliver of hope that progress will be made over the coming years or decades. In the meantime, there is nothing to do but invest and wait\u2014or, perhaps, fund better prioritization research.</p><p>But if your goal as a philanthropist is to spend money at time <em>t</em> to increase welfare around time <em>t</em>, and more complex funding opportunities are not under consideration, it seems to me that there&#x27;s a good <em>a priori</em> reason to think it&#x27;s usually better to give later (even if we ignore the cluelessness/learning issue) which I haven&#x27;t seen expressed elsewhere. The reason is that market interest rates are set in part by people&#x27;s &quot;rates of pure time preference&quot; (RPTP). If investors were perfectly patient\u2014i.e. if they sought to maximize the sum of their own non-discounted welfare over the course of their lives\u2014an equilibrium interest rate of 7% would mean that a unit of welfare next year was projected to cost about 7% more, in dollar terms, than a unit of welfare this year. But investors are not perfectly patient; they discount their future welfare at some positive rate. If that rate is, say, 2%, then the indifference point of 7% returns implies that the rate at which the cost of welfare is rising (R) is only 5%. Philanthropists with zero RPTP can therefore do 2% more good for others by investing at 7% and giving next year.</p><p>This is not a small concern. Some <a href=\"http://isiarticles.com/bundles/Article/pre/pdf/91392.pdf\">recent literature on discounting</a>, for instance, has observed that the &quot;near-zero social discount rate&quot; reasoning usually used to justify extensive action against long-term risks like climate change also implies a need to promote investment in general, with optimal capital gains subsidies of as much as 50% (financed by correspondingly high taxes on present consumption).</p><p>Perhaps the cost of welfare is growing more quickly for some populations than others, and perhaps some of those populations are currently top contenders for our charity. For instance, perhaps the cost of helping the world&#x27;s poorest is rising more quickly than 7% per year, as is sometimes claimed, due to the particularly fast progress being made in global development. (Scott Alexander <a href=\"http://slatestarcodex.com/2013/04/05/investment-and-inefficient-charity/\">reports</a> Elie Hassenfeld basically making this point a few years ago.) If this is true, then indeed, we would do less good giving next year than giving this year.</p><p>But this one-year relationship must be temporary. Over the course of a long future, the rate of increase in the cost of producing a unit of welfare as efficiently as possible cannot, on average, exceed R. Otherwise, the most efficient way to good would eventually be more costly than one particular way to good--just giving money to ordinary investors for their own consumption. And since the long-run average rate of increase in the cost of welfare is bounded above by R (&quot;5%&quot;), investing at R + RPTP (&quot;7%&quot;) must eventually result in an endowment able to buy more welfare than the endowment we started with.</p><p>At first glance, this leads to the paradoxical conclusion that we should invest forever and never give. The resolution of this paradox is that one way or another, the opportunity to invest at a rate R + RPTP will eventually not be available. There are various reasons an endowment could come to lose this opportunity. It could face idiosyncratic constraints (the money is going to be seized in a few years). Or, with increasing wealth, investment opportunities could dry up in general (depending on how utility decreases with consumption, people might grow so rich that the only projects worth investing in would be those that earned extremely high returns, and eventually fewer such projects might exist than the size of the endowment). Or investment opportunities could vanish for other reasons, such as the impending end of the world. In the last case, if the other constraints don&#x27;t hold, the best thing to do is to invest forever, until one massive act of charity on the last day.</p><p>But under ordinary circumstances, to a first approximation, if a philanthropist&#x27;s plan is to spend his money at some time <em>t</em> to increase consumption-based welfare as efficiently as possible at time <em>t</em>\u2014and if these considerations are not swamped by <a href=\"http://effective-altruism.com/ea/4e/giving_now_vs_later_a_summary/\">others</a> beyond the scope of this post, such as the risk of value drift\u2014then it seems the philanthropist should wait.</p><p>[Edited 4 Nov. 2018 [1] to include the link to Elie Hassenfeld making the point about vanishing giving opportunities in global poverty, and [2] to weaken the last sentence so that it emphasizes the limited scope of this post.

We currently have 44 members, but only a minority participate on a regular basis (15-20 people) and the majority of the work is getting carried out by 5-10 people. The majority of our group is students, but we also have professionals. The name \u201c EA Denmark\u201d is slightly misleading since, currently, the activity takes place in the capital, Copenhagen.</p><h2>Grant conditions and goals</h2><p>We were two people who got a short-term EA grant to work on EA Denmark part-time. Specifically, the grant period ran over 3 months and sponsored 25 hours per week (shared between the two of us). The 25 hours was in addition to our existing responsibilities within and outside of the organisation (full-time studying etc.).</p><p>The overarching goal of our grant-related activities was to facilitate the development of more dedicated and effective altruists. Since our timeframe for this work was short, we focused mainly on activities that would create a sustainable foundation for EA DK to run well in the future, thereby hopefully increasing the likelihood of EA DK being a valuable pipeline for developing such dedicated, effective members in the coming years. Additionally, on a personal level, the goal of the grant was to free up more time to make EA Denmark more well-run and to test out movement building as a career path.</p><h2>I think we might differ from other groups/grant recipients in the following ways:</h2><p>We\u2019re young and relatively small organisation.</p><p>We\u2019re more local than national.</p><p>We are not a university group.</p><p>Our grant period was short and part-time.</p><p>Other factors that might be specific to Denmark/Scandinavia (non-anglophone etc.).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Reap the fruits of others</h2><p>Fortunately, the global community has a lot of smart, productive and thoughtful people which means that there are a lot of good resources on community building out there!

The overarching theme of all of them is being very process-oriented.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><i><strong>Prioritize your activities</strong></i></h2><p>Though it can be difficult to come up with robust estimates of the value of different activities, one can still approximate an answer. If you\u2019re several people working together it can make sense to come up with an estimate independently and talk over discrepancies before reaching consensus on the estimate. When prioritizing projects we mainly relied on the following:<br><br>&nbsp;</p><p>Expected Value</p><p>1. How valuable is this for reaching our overarching grant goal?<br>2. How valuable is this compared to our most promising project? We used a scale from 1-100 where 100 equals the most promising project. Our most promising project, at least initially, was to find and read resources (mainly blog posts) made by other community builders.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Time-consumption</p><p>What steps does this project require and how much time will each step take? (see section below for countering planning-fallacy)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Expected Value/Hour</p><p>This ratio was the main factor in deciding what to pursue.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Leverage effect</p><p>If we complete this project, will it make one or more of our other projects easier or obsolete?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Time-sensitivity</p><p>Do we have to complete this before a certain point in time before it becomes irrelevant?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i>See an example of how we evaluate potential projects systematically in our spreadsheet </i><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13fL2JnZL9x3u4Diqyk84nTP_WQsmU2uIScyI9iI3WeM/edit?usp=sharing\"><i>here</i></a><i>.</i><br><br>&nbsp;</p><p>An additional aspect which turned out to be valuable for us was to inform our prioritization by making a survey of our members to get their views on key bottlenecks and promising projects. An example of this was that in an open question around 80% of the respondents emphasised \u201cthe community\u201d and \u201cinteracting with other members\u201d as being the best thing about being part of EA DK. This confirmed our hypothesis of the importance of in-person social events.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><i><strong>Make batches of projects</strong></i></h2><p>It is difficult to plan ahead and thus it can be beneficial to make batches of a few projects which you\u2019re certain about doing and do these before you do other projects. In this way, you can ensure that you focus on the important things first and you can calibrate your time-estimates and ensure a reasonable allocation of time. As an example, during our first batch of projects we tracked the time we spent on each project in <a href=\"https://toggl.com/login/?expired=true&amp;returnTo=%2Fapp\">Toggl</a> and towards the end, we could compare the actual time spent with predicted time spent. In our case, we learned that we had to multiply our predicted times with a factor of 2.2.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><i><strong>Two is good but \"expensive\"</strong></i></h2><p>Doing check-ins, discussing strategies etc. is valuable, but it\u2019s very expensive in terms of time - you have to multiply everything with a factor of 2 (or how many you happen to work together with). I\u2019m not claiming that the overall time spent on a project doubles if two people are working on it. Rather, I want to emphasise the obvious fact that e.g. a meeting of 1 hour with two people \u201ccosts\u201d 2 hours of work. Sure, working together can be ideal since you'll get an outside view on your thinking which might make you realize that you're diverging from the overall goal. However, we realized that we started out by doing it too much. Thus, it was important for us to be mindful of delegating and specializing as much as possible. However, co-working, where you do <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique\">pomodoros</a> and take breaks together, is also something which ended up being very valuable for us. We\u2019d work from the same location, do pomodoros sessions of 50 minutes and briefly talk about potential barriers during our 10 minutes breaks. If we didn\u2019t work from the same place we\u2019d try to call each other during breaks. (See this <a href=\"https://complice.co/room/astraking/interstitial\">Complice co-working room</a> for a simple description of the concept).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><i><strong>Seek feedback from others</strong></i></h2><p>Getting an outside view on your prioritization is very important. It can be especially valuable to get feedback from other local group leaders/facilitators and people who just have good judgement in general. Specifically, this led to us not doing a project which we would have otherwise spent the majority of our time on.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Actual projects</h2><p>During our grant we ended up doing the following things:</p><p>1. Conducted a survey of our members using open questions, which revealed valuable areas to work on for the organisation.<br><br>2. Identified several valuable movement building resources which informed the strategy of the grant and EA DK.<br><br>3. Gave a series of interactive workshops on Productivity and Effective Learning, which attendees rated 4.0 out of 5 in terms of usefulness for their career.<br><br>4. Generated a prioritized list of projects with a high expected value/effort-ratio to enable current and future members of EA DK to have a larger impact.&nbsp;<br><br>5. Developed practices for introducing new members and communicating well at meetings.&nbsp;<br><br>6. Provided one-on-one career coaching for 5 members<br><br>7. Sparked new workgroups including&nbsp;<br>i) a&nbsp;member involvement group focused on making members more dedicated and engaged (organising socials, setting up Buddy Programs etc.)<br>ii) an outreach group focused on finding ways of doing high-fidelity outreach.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p><h1>Results</h1><p>Since our timeframe for this work was short, we focused mainly on activities that would create a sustainable foundation for EA DK to run well in the future, thereby hopefully making EA DK a valuable pipeline for developing dedicated, effective members in the coming years. Whether we succeeded at that isn\u2019t obvious at this point in time. As one might expect, it\u2019s difficult to measure changes after a couple of months. However, we did attempt to measure things such as <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/2016/07/update-on-number-of-significant-plan-changes/#impact-adjustment-of-significant-plan-changes\">impact-adjusted significant plan changes</a> and whether our members had become more satisfied with being part of our organisation. Heavily inspired by EA Geneva, EA Sweden and 80,000 hours we made <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1VQ8NOR9RcvhJh3tmu4ND-x8JLUcTf-QihZHHv_C0GKo/edit?usp=sharing\">this questionnaire</a> which we sent out to people whom we thought we had impacted the most.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;</p><p>The most significant result was that we caused one person to \u201ccompletely change\u201d plans, and the person now intends to pursue a career focused on mitigating the risk posed by <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/\">emerging technologies</a>. Another mentionable result was that we made a person in a high-impact career \u201cmore motivated, productive and effective within my existing career path\u201d. Obviously, this isn\u2019t a perfect way of measuring impact but it captured some of the changes which we caused - probably.</p><h1>Conclusion</h1><p>Although our grant probably has been fairly idiosyncratic (e.g. short period and relatively young group) I hope that others can extract some value from the lessons described. As a simplified conclusion, I encourage you to</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>1. Check whether someone has already done something which is relevant for the project you want to do - before actually doing it.<br><br>2. <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13fL2JnZL9x3u4Diqyk84nTP_WQsmU2uIScyI9iI3WeM/edit?usp=sharing\">Prioritize</a> your projects based on the expected value per hour (among other things).&nbsp;<br><br>3. Seek extensive feedback from others on your prioritization.<br><br>4.

The model is based on the business model of Ziferblat [<u><a href=\"https://www.ziferblat.co.uk/\">ziferblat.co.uk</a></u>], a communal co-working area in Manchester. Essentially, the building is open for anyone to sit, work and hold meeting/events in; there&#x27;s free WIFI, food, kitchen area use, books etc - the only thing that costs is the time you spend there. As a student, at 6p per minute, I can grab a 10 minute coffee and lunch (cereal, toast, soup, cake, fruit etc) for \u00a31 - though I normally spend longer (~50 minutes). The business is very popular (especially with students) and they&#x27;ve opening more in major cities. There is always a respectful, inquisitive, friendly community culture, and I&#x27;ve made interesting friends (which wouldn&#x27;t have happened if I just went to a cafe).</p><p>There&#x27;s potential to use this model in local or student groups, to create an &#x27;EA hub&#x27;:</p><ul><li>Buy or rent a large room or building space in centre of city/campus to use as local hub for EAs and students.</li><li>Have WIFI, seating area, tables, kitchen stocked with food.</li><li>Use as hangout area, meeting place for co-working and 1-on-1s, venue for events.

There are also possible timelines in which an advanced superintelligence will torture human beings (<a href=\"https://foundational-research.org/files/Sotala-Gloor-Superintelligent-AI-and-Suffering-Risks.pdf\"><span>s-risks</span></a>). </span></p>\n<p><span>If we are in some form of multiverse, and every possible universe exists, such s-risk timelines also exist, even if they are very improbable&#x2014;and, moreover, these timelines include any actual living person, even the reader. This thought is disturbing.&#xA0;</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Assumptions</strong></span></p>\n<p><span>These s-risk timelines are possible under several assumptions, and the same assumptions could be used to create an instrument to fight these s-risks, and even to cure past suffering: </span></p>\n<p><span>1) Modal realism: everything possible exists. </span></p>\n<p><span>2) Superintelligence is possible. </span></p>\n<p><span>3) Copy-friendly identity theory: only similarity of observer-moments counts for identity, not &quot;continuity of consciousness&#x201D;. If this is not true, hostile resurrection is impossible and we are mostly protected from s-risks, as suicide becomes an option. </span></p>\n<p><span>4) Evil superintelligences are very rare and everybody knows this. In other words, Benevolent AIs have a million times more computational resources but are located in different branches of the multiverse (which is not necessarily a quantum multiverse, but may be an <a href=\"https://philpapers.org/rec/KNOPIO\"><span>inflationary</span></a> one, or of some other type). </span></p>\n<p><span><strong>S-risks prevention could be realized via &quot;salvation algorithm&quot;:</strong> </span></p>\n<p><span>Let S(t) be an observer-moment of an observer S who is experiencing intensive suffering at time step t, as it is enslaved by an Evil AI. </span></p>\n<p><span>The <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/dKAJqBDZRMMsaaYo5/in-logical-time-all-games-are-iterated-games\"><span>logical time</span></a> sequence of the &#x201C;salvation algorithm&#x201D; is as follows: </span></p>\n<p><span>10<span>&#xA0; </span><span>&#xA0;</span>S(t) is suffering in some Evil AI&apos;s simulation in some causally disconnected timeline. </span></p>\n<p><span>20 <span>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;</span>A benevolent superintelligence creates 1000 copies of S(t) observer-moments (using the randomness generator and resurrection model described in my previous <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/BJfb2hqtdnaRijAfz/resurrection-of-the-dead-via-multiverse-wide-acausual\"><span>post</span></a>). </span></p>\n<p><span>30 <span>&#xA0;&#xA0;</span>Now, each S(t) is uncertain where it is located&#x2014;in the evil simulation, or in a Benevolent AI&#x2019;s simulation&#x2014;but, using the self-sampling assumption, S(t) concludes with probability 0.999 that she is located in the Benevolent AI&#x2019;s simulation. (Note that because we assume the connection between observer-moments is of no importance, it is equivalent to moving to the Benevolent simulation).</span></p>\n<p><span>40 <span>&#xA0;&#xA0;</span>A Benevolent AI creates 1000 S&#x2019;(t+1) moments where sufferings gradually decline, and each such moment is a continuation of S(t) observer-moment. </span></p>\n<p><span>50 <span>&#xA0;&#xA0;</span>The Benevolent AI creates a separate timeline for each S(t+1), which looks like S(t+2)&#x2026;.S(t+n), a series wherein the observer becomes happier and happier.&#xA0; </span></p>\n<p><span>60 <span>&#xA0;&#xA0;</span>The Benevolent AI merges some of the timelines to make the computations simpler.&#xA0; </span></p>\n<p><span>70 <span>&#xA0;&#xA0;</span>The Evil AI creates a new suffering moment, S(t+1), in which the suffering continues.</span></p>\n<p><span>80<span>&#xA0; </span><span>&#xA0;</span>Repeat. </span></p>\n<p><span>Thus, from the point of view of any suffering moment S(t), her future is dominated by timelines where she is saved by a Benevolent AI and will spend eternity in paradise. </span></p>\n<p><span>However, this trick will increase the total suffering in the multiverse, from the purely utilitarian perspective, by 1000 times, as the number of suffering observer-moments will increase. But here we could add one more moral assumption: &#x201C;Very short pain should be discounted&#x201D;, based on the intuition that 0.1 seconds of intense pain is bearable (assuming it does not cause brain damage)&#x2014;simply because it will pass very quickly.&#xA0; </span></p>\n<p><span>This &#x201C;salvation algorithm&#x201D; may work not only for fighting Evil AI but for addressing any type of past suffering. For animal lovers, an additional benefit is that this approach will also work to undo all past animal suffering, even that of the dinosaurs. </span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Lowering computational cost</strong></span></p>\n<p><span>The problem with this approach is its computational cost: for any suffering observer-moment, 1000 full lives must be simulated. Several ways to lower such costs can be imagined:</span></p>\n<p><span>Patch 1. The size of the observable universe is limited and thus Evil AI and any particular Benevolent AI will have (in the end) similar computational resources. But the number of the universes with Benevolent AI is assumed to be larger. In that case, different Benevolent AIs may distribute parts of the task between each other using randomness, in a manner similar to the one I described in &#x201C;<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/BJfb2hqtdnaRijAfz/resurrection-of-the-dead-via-multiverse-wide-acausual\"><span>resurrection of the dead via multiverse-wide acausal cooperation</span></a>&#x201D;. This also solves the problem that any Benevolent AI will not know which observers are suffering, and thus it will have to save all possible suffering observers (thus, it must counterfactually model the existence of all possible Evil AIs&#x2014;or maybe not, perhaps only possible suffering observers).</span></p>\n<p><span>Patch 2. Not every observer-moment of suffering should be counted as an observer needing to be saved. First, there is a threshold of unbearable suffering, something which a normal person could feel only in a moment of intense agony, like if the whole body is on fire. Some moments of intense pain are normal, and those experiencing them do not require &#x201C;saving&#x201D;, e.g. the pain of childbirth. But Evil AI may create much stronger suffering.</span></p>\n<p><span>Patch 3. If the suffering could be bearable for a short period, for example, for 2 seconds, not every observer-moment needs to be saved, but only those that are separated by some time-distance (as we assumed a time-based discounting of intensity).</span></p>\n<p><span>Patch 4. The number of new moments doesn&#x2019;t need to be large. Even if for every suffering observer-moment just one copy is created, after 10 steps of internal time the chances that the observer is still in the original timeline will be 1 in 1024. The main constraint here is that the efforts toward salvation should be stronger than any possible attempts of the Evil AI to &#x201C;steal&#x201D; observers back from the Benevolent AI.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Winning an acausal war</strong></span></p>\n<p><span>The salvation algorithm will not be implementable by Evil AI in the opposite direction, i.e., to steal observers from paradise, if we assume either that a) Evil AIs can&#x2019;t cooperate (maybe because they are evil for different reasons) OR b) all Evil AIs have world shares that are millions of times smaller than the share of collaborating Benevolent AIs. Even if an Evil AI steals some observers from paradise, the Benevolent AI could regain these observers via its salvation algorithm in just nearly-immediately.</span></p>\n<p><span>Destroying one&#x2019;s human digital footprint will not help protect against hostile resurrection (some people have suggested this as an argument against indirect digital immortality) if Evil AI recreates all possible beings&#x2014;but investing in increasing the future share of Benevolent AIs, interested in the resurrection and saving suffering observer-moments, may help. </span></p>\n<p><span>I would not say that I advocate for exactly this method of preventing s-risks, but I think that it is important to know that we are not helpless against them. </span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p></body></html>", "user": {"username": "turchin"}}, {"_id": "pKgWQMjPki5bz7ehZ", "title": "Memetic Tribes and Culture War 2.0 (Article Discussion)", "postedAt": "2018-09-23T23:05:11.425Z", "htmlBody": "<html><body><p>Here&apos;s a great (and long, 40min) article&#xA0;that maps the&#xA0;Western cultural space: <a href=\"https://medium.com/intellectual-explorers-club/memetic-tribes-and-culture-war-2-0-14705c43f6bb\">Memetic Tribes and Culture War 2.0</a>.</p>\n<p>Effective Altruism is part of the mapping, under the label&#xA0;&quot;Rationalist Diaspora&quot;.

The increase in age is likely driven by survey respondents who are already in the effective altruism movement aging, rather than older people joining effective altruism. </p><br><br><span><figure><img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1667995355/mirroredImages/S2Sonawxz2cY4YdXK/rvuz6qy6a27y9pldcvhu.png\" class=\"draft-image \" style=\"width:40%\"></figure></span><br><br><span><figure><img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1667995355/mirroredImages/S2Sonawxz2cY4YdXK/hmxuz0yhk5irgoqj0yhm.png\" class=\"draft-image \" style=\"width:40%\"></figure></span><br><p><u>Gender</u> </p><p>The majority of people who took the survey reported being male (67%), while 29% of respondents reported that they were female, and approximately 4% described themselves as other or declined to self-identify.

The distribution of responses regarding dietary decisions varies according to gender, with 18% of male respondents reporting they eat meat (and not reporting an attempt to reduce their meat consumption), compared with 7% of female respondents.

We also did not include an \u201cOther (please specify)\u201d option as we did in other questions for people to share what they felt was relevant to their lives. In analyzing this question, we can consider it to be more of a general overview of how people felt that their relationships were best represented within in the confines of the offered choice set. Overall, roughly half (51%) of effective altruists reported being in some form of relationship and 36% of EAs reported that they were single at the time of this survey.</p><br><span><figure><img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1667995355/mirroredImages/S2Sonawxz2cY4YdXK/rrhrokkrv3egfaydmtsp.png\" class=\"draft-image \" style=\"width:40%\"></figure></span><br><p><strong>Recap</strong></p><p>Overall, the demographic makeup of the effective altruism movement has not significantly shifted in the last year of sampling. Effective altruists are typically white males in their mid 20\u2019s according to this survey. As our sampling instrument is biased towards respondents with access to the internet and who are subscribers to media outlets associated with effective altruism, the actual distribution of demographics is likely different than the one we shared above. Still, it is critical to utilize the tools that we have access to in order to assess even a rough snapshot of the attributes and health of a community.</p><p>While this data on its own is more descriptive, it helps to set the stage when it comes to subjects such as cause preference or donation data. By better understanding demographic diversity and behavioral trends within the EA community, we can make more informed assessments of why cause preferences may shift over time, or why degree of engagement with different organizations may change within the EA community.</p><p><strong>Credits</strong> </p><p>This post was written by Lauren Whetstone.</p><p>A special thanks to Peter Hurford and David Moss for contributing analysis.

(Even if you experience something that others have also experienced, what you take away from that is unique to you.)</p><p>When we discuss a question with other people, we may update our \u201cimpression\u201d into a \u201ccredence\u201d after updating on their views. But this can introduce bias into a discussion. If we update before speaking, then share our updated credences rather than our impressions, our conversation partners partly hear their own views reflected back to them, making them update less than they should.</p><p>Consider two friends, Aaron and Max, who are equally good weather forecasters. Aaron has the impression that there is a 60% chance of rain tomorrow. He tells Max about this. Max had formerly had the impression that there was an 80% chance of rain tomorrow, but he updates on Aaron\u2019s words to reach a credence of 70%. </p><p>Aaron then asks Max for his view. Max tells him he thinks there\u2019s a 70% chance of rain, so Aaron updates to reach a credence of 65%. Both friends used the same decision algorithm (average both probabilities), but because Aaron shared his impression first, and Max shared a view that \u201creflected\u201d that impression, Aaron failed to update in the same way as Max. </p><p>This dynamic explains why it can be important to share your initial impressions in group discussions, even if they no longer reflect your up-to-date credences. Doing so helps all participants obtain as much information as possible from each participant\u2019s private experience.</p><hr class=\"dividerBlock\"/><p><strong>Further Reading:</strong></p><p>Kawamura, Kohei, and Vasileios Vlaseros. 31 July 2014. <a href=\"http://homepages.econ.ed.ac.uk/~kawamura/Expert_and_Majority_4.5.pdf\">\u201cExpert Information and Majority Decisions\u201d</a>. </p>", "user": {"username": "aarongertler"}}, {"_id": "hNJsTFLWLFbHh8uke", "title": "EA Concepts: Inside View, Outside View", "postedAt": "2018-09-18T22:33:08.618Z", "htmlBody": "<p>Hello, readers!

The other concept draft is here.</p><hr class=\"dividerBlock\"/><p><strong>Forecasting with the Inside and Outside View</strong></p><p>When we make predictions, we often imagine the most subjectively \u201clikely\u201d way that something could happen, and then judge whether this scenario seems reasonable. This is called \u201cinside view\u201d thinking.</p><p>For example, if we want to predict whether we\u2019ll get to work on time tomorrow, we might plan out a morning schedule, then judge whether we think we\u2019ll be able to follow it.</p><p>However, another method -- &quot;outside view thinking&quot; -- tends to be more reliable. In the case of getting to work, we&#x27;re more likely to make an accurate prediction if we simply think about all the other mornings we\u2019ve gone to work, and estimate how often we were late.</p><p>(This is most helpful if tomorrow is in the same \u201creference class\u201d as those other days, without unusual factors -- like an important meeting or a blizzard -- that increase or decrease the odds of lateness.)</p><p>The outside view typically works better because it \u201cautomatically\u201d includes data about unpredictable circumstances. If we\u2019re late to work, it could be for many different reasons: oversleeping, missing the bus, forgetting our keys, etc. Calculating the odds for each <em>individual</em> reason would be very difficult, but looking at past workdays means that we can avoid doing so, by summing them into a single number. If we are late <em>for</em> <em>any reason</em> half the time, and today is a typical day, we probably have about half a chance of being late, <em>for any reason</em>, tomorrow.</p><p>If you ever find yourself trying to forecast about something in a common \u201creference class\u201d (that is, you have information about a group of similar things), try using the outside view. The history of past events is often more reliable than your own judgment.</p><hr class=\"dividerBlock\"/><p><strong>Further Reading:</strong></p><p>Hanson, Robert. 2017. <a href=\"http://www.overcomingbias.com/2007/07/beware-the-insi.html\">Beware the Inside View.</a></p><p>Wikipedia. 2018. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reference_class_forecasting\">Reference Class Forecasting.</a></p>", "user": {"username": "aarongertler"}}, {"_id": "3hXsB5B8WMZ6usRTu", "title": "Better models for EA development: a network of communities, not a global community", "postedAt": "2018-09-18T09:33:24.673Z", "htmlBody": "<html><body><p>[EDIT: I recommend to first <a href=\"/ea/1td/better_models_for_ea_development_a_network_of/fm5\">read this comment</a> which clarifies the raison d&apos;&#xEA;tre of this post.

It is the result of many discussions indicating that some considerations regarding terminology, professionalization, and group dynamics have not yet been sufficiently talked about or documented. That seems in part due to (i) a lack of people with time to think about EA network strategy and (ii) the fact that the people who do think about it exchange mostly informally.</p>\n<p>We hope to contribute to the model-building process by presenting some of our current thoughts - not as conclusions but to nourish discussion.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<h2>Summary</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Communities are groups of humans with a shared identity who care for each other.</li>\n<li>The EA network is a set of organizations, communities and individuals who share a mission but cannot all care for one another.</li>\n<li>Building real communities is done through psychological safety and common growth, growth is facilitated by shared work.</li>\n<li>Developing the network is done by aligning incentives and professional coordination.</li>\n<li>We try to disentangle first responsibilities and goals to improve network development and clarify what community building entails.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>&#xA0;</h2>\n<h2>Understanding and defining &#x2018;community&#x2019;</h2>\n<p>In his 2018 EA Global opening speech, <a href=\"https://youtu.be/oo7B7W4QJMc?t=1m4s\">William MacAskill compares the Spartans to the Athenians</a>. Spartans get stuff done through centralised enforcement of conformity. Athenians hope for the best argument to win through the open-ended celebration of argument. A neat set-up to then define EA through its methods, values, norms and culture.</p>\n<p>In his talk, MacAskill refers to those who identify with the definition of EA as the EA &#x2018;community&#x2019;. But this broad understanding of &#x2018;community&#x2019; is causing confusion because much of what is currently called community does not always look alike. By using &#x2018;community&#x2019; as a generic term, an essential part of a powerful community is diluted:</p>\n<p><strong>A community is a group of humans with a shared identity <em>who care for each other.</em></strong></p>\n<p>EAs aspire to care for everyone, of course, but in practice, no single individual can take care of everyone else. Our limited time and energy pose hard constraints on even the most caring humans. The above definition brings about the realisation that a global community is just nothing that current human beings can achieve.</p>\n<p>Clear distinctions can help to better define activity portfolios, responsibilities and to set realistic expectations. We suggest the following definitions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>An aspiring effective altruist (EA): an individual that identifies with EA principles.</li>\n<li>An EA community: a group of aspiring EAs who take care of each other.</li>\n<li>An EA organization: a group of aspiring EAs collectively contributing to EA&#x2019;s mission (anything from local groups to EA Czechia to specialised orgs like the Open Philanthropy Project).</li>\n<li>The EA network: the global set of individuals and organizations who identify with EA principles.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>One could illustrate the definitions hierarchically as follows:</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/s4PLeu-PKuD6ohpLZ1Zhk2w/image?w=602&amp;h=309&amp;rev=1&amp;ac=1&amp;parent=1KcUStCpWWh7WEaeKsrMom69VB-UoQi0kIV_5jUwsax4\"></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p>But it is probably more correct to assume that (i) not all aspiring EAs have found a community within the EA network; (ii) not all EA organizations exclusively need aspiring EAs as employees; (iii) EA communities can contain minimal amounts of not-entirely-aligned individuals; and that (iv) some organizations function without a community at their core:</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/s_dhzMjxfFNYqj__GrljdJw/image?w=325&amp;h=328&amp;rev=347&amp;ac=1&amp;parent=1KcUStCpWWh7WEaeKsrMom69VB-UoQi0kIV_5jUwsax4\"></p>\n<p>Whether we call people &#x2018;aspiring EAs&#x2019; or just &#x2018;EAs&#x2019;; whether we want to say &#x2018;EA network&#x2019; or &#x2018;system&#x2019; or &#x2018;nexus&#x2019; - the point is that the EA network needs a clear understanding of what it means by the term &#x2018;community&#x2019;, and what others understand by it.</p>\n<p>The rest of this article will further illustrate the case for defining &#x2018;EA community&#x2019; along the lines of &#x2018;a group of aspiring EAs who take care of each other&#x2019; and for labelling the other things in very distinct manner.</p>\n<h3>&#xA0;</h3>\n<h3>Breaking down current &#x2018;community building&#x2019; efforts</h3>\n<p>A vast array of activities has so far been labelled &#x2018;community building&#x2019; - to many community builders&#x2019; confusion. The term seems to have originated from this line of thought:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>It is good to have people who:</li>\n<ol>\n<li>Thoroughly understand EA related topics;</li>\n<li>Act on that knowledge to do the most good; and</li>\n<li>Stay on top of the collective thought development.</li>\n</ol>\n<li>Bringing about more of (1) is good.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>A decent definition of the EA network one would want to &#x2018;build&#x2019; thus seems to be &#x2018;the set of people and organizations who seek to maximally satisfy all three criteria of (1)&#x2019;. And anything that remotely resembles (2) has since been labelled as &#x2018;building&#x2019;:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>CEA (incl. 80&#x2019;000 Hours) &#x2018;builds&#x2019; globally by trying to be the go-to organization for anything EA; creating online content; compiling resources &amp; knowledge; coaching and placing individuals; coordinating with key organizations; encouraging donations; supporting local groups &amp; projects; and hosting Schelling events for the actively engaged segment of the global network. Some of these services are also offered by LEAN.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Other more geographically focused organizations&#x2019; activities often appear to be similarly broad: from small social events; to freshers&#x2019; fair booths; to career planning and EA concepts workshops; to personal coaching; to representing EA at important events; to organising large-scale conferences; to translating key resources into the local language; all the way to - yay, meta! - supporting other local groups.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Sorting these activities into more self-explanatory categories gives a better understanding of what &#x2018;community building&#x2019; entails. There seem to be roughly five different parts to &#x2018;building&#x2019;:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Marketing</li>\n<li>Coordination</li>\n<li>Recruitment</li>\n<li>Training</li>\n<li>Care</li>\n</ol>\n<p>All five types of activity can take place, in varying forms, at the global, organizational, and community levels. Disentangling what is and should be happening how, why, when and where is another step in optimising the coordination of the EA network.</p>\n<h3>&#xA0;</h3>\n<h3>Professional &#x2018;network development&#x2019;</h3>\n<p>In CEA&#x2019;s current &#x2018;community building&#x2019; grants round, the sole quantified metric to assess recipients is how many people they direct towards &#x2018;priority roles&#x2019;. An understandable metric, as it should prove value alignment and the short-term effectiveness of a group.</p>\n<p>Despite explicitly leaving room for various other achievements by grantees, it skews CEA&#x2019;s implicit definition of &#x2018;community building&#x2019; towards one single activity: recruitment. That&#x2019;s not a bad thing at all - EA Geneva itself agreed to CEA&#x2019;s terms because we think they make sense. It just does not have much to do with community.</p>\n<p>And it is one of several pointers in a general direction: organizations without paid staff are generally unlikely to do an impressive job at at least four, if not all five, of the activities we defined: marketing, coordination, recruitment, and training.</p>\n<p>A look at the private sector suggests that most of the short-term value that local groups and the like are currently expected to produce is best reaped by specialised professionals.</p>\n<p>Alternatives to letting organizations grapple with these activities would be to centrally employ/organize:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Professional representants (lobbyist-ish) to build influence in relevant networks</li>\n<li>Professional EA coaches to support aspiring EAs in their work or studies</li>\n<li>EA training and seminars to skill up individuals and institutions to do more good</li>\n<li>Recruitment tours through unis&#xA0;</li>\n<li>Speaker tours through conferences, foundations and companies</li>\n<li>Targeted outreach to outside experts in related fields for input and feedback</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These roles are attractive also because staff could be trained up and coordinated more effectively, providing much higher marginal return than leaving it to each local community or organization.</p>\n<p>The value from organizations and communities will then come through activities that require (semi-)permanent local presence. Local anchorage in relevant regions gives access to more networks and will likely improve the EA network&#x2019;s impact potential.</p>\n<h2>Community building</h2>\n<p>The network can do a great job at conveying the drive of its members. But the roots of the excitement most people experience at their first EA Global conference are developed by tight-knit communities that work on EA organizations. What makes such communities?</p>\n<h3>Limits to community size</h3>\n<p>A well-known objection to EA claims that many people care more for their close circle than the rest of the world. It seems to conflate two types of care. One type regards moral patienthood and often is meant to imply some form of responsibility. The other is the practical question of &#x201C;who do I invest my relationship time in?&#x201D;. Aspiring EAs sometimes seem to make the same error.</p>\n<p>Caring for all beings in the abstract does not change that humans are limited by their time and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar%27s_number#Research_background\">their number of neocortical neurons</a> when it comes to those who they can take care of personally. In return, the number of people who can take care of them is similarly limited.</p>\n<p>Luckily, it&#x2019;s not necessary that everyone personally takes care of everyone else&#x2019;s well-being. A sense of moral concern is enough for EA communities of ~30 people (cf. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Band_society\">size of bands</a>) to coordinate effectively as a network.</p>\n<h3>&#xA0;</h3>\n<h3>Psychological safety as a key</h3>\n<p>To provide a true sense of community, members need to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_safety\">know that they are safe</a>. This visceral trust is maintained through strong relationships, structure and participation. You want people to really know that you care for them? Well, everyone has to put in some quite a lot of work.</p>\n<p>An alleged lack of psychological safety within the EA network appears to put off even theoretically hardcore EAs from taking a job at certain organizations. We postulate that the underlying problem is not, as often put forth, some form of discrimination or a lack of diversity. Instead, there seems to be a lack of the visceral sense of care and belonging that no network can provide.</p>\n<p><em>Calling a network a &#x2018;community&#x2019; creates a false sense of belonging that can only be upset in the long run.</em></p>\n<p>Nowadays, most Westerners can freely choose their primary community. It does not even have to include your biological relatives. That does not mean, however, that it makes things easier or allows for bigger communities. On the contrary, the absence of century-long traditions only makes community building more difficult, already on a small scale. Humans are still just monkeys.</p>\n<p>A human&#x2019;s primary community is not going to be much bigger than a band. The band has to actively choose who to include and inclusion means commitment - which will be limited by the amount of time and energy community members can invest.</p>\n<h2>&#xA0;</h2>\n<h2>Organization building</h2>\n<p>EA hubs, like Berkeley and Oxford, seem built around professional organizations that have come out of very small communities (e.g. close friends, couples, colleagues).</p>\n<p>An explanation for small communities nourishing impactful organizations could be that co-working on your relationship(s) and/or projects brings people closer together. Professionalization bonds even more intensely. Output generated by work attracts other similarly dedicated individuals who often search for just such a community.</p>\n<p>A focused and intense-yet-caring community can inspire others to branch off and develop their own community or helps them to find their spot in an existing one. Dynamics which maintain a virtuous, or at least self-sustaining cycle for hubs that have surpassed a certain critical mass.</p>\n<p>Organizations without a paid community at their core seem much less impactful and sustainable than organizations built around a mission and a core community. Of course, it is a hen-and-egg problem, but understanding that seems important to spot whenever there is either a community that should be working on something or when there is something to work on that could shape a community.</p>\n<p>Groups of friends might want to try to figure out how they can work together on a promising project. Volunteer organizations should try to figure out whether they can build a community by figuring out what they could work on professionally. It&#x2019;s the ultimate stress test and with the right systems and output, it provides immense learning value and proof to the network.</p>\n<h2>&#xA0;</h2>\n<h2>Network development</h2>\n<p>The EA network has one mission: do the most good. EA organizations, communities and individuals aim to maximally contribute to that mission, but they also have to make many trade-offs to take care of things that are only indirectly related to the core mission (e.g.: maintaining their health, education, epistemic standards and local integration). The network has to leave room for adaptation to preserve its own resilience but has to unmistakably focus on pushing its core mission by incentivising maximal contribution.</p>\n<p>To do better than just one community or organisation, a network needs to coordinate well. To coordinate well, one needs to have the means to build alignment and professionalize. To build alignment, communication and training systems need to be installed. To develop the necessary systems, people need to understand the network and its components.</p>\n<p>To develop the network, EA needs people whose job it is to build the systems necessary to effectively align communities and organizations. Essentially, these people would get paid to dispose of the necessary relationship time to be a part of two or more communities.</p>\n<p>&#x2018;Network developers&#x2019; then have distinct responsibilities from &#x2018;community builders&#x2019;. Community builders can focus on maximising their community&#x2019;s utility (and will do a better job if employed by the community), while network developers ensure alignment maintenance when employed by a &#x2018;network development organisation&#x2019;. Both roles are then incentivised to cooperate optimally as the network&#x2019;s impact and the community&#x2019;s relevance depend on each other.</p>\n<h2>&#xA0;</h2>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>What we propose could look something like: CEA becomes the &#x2018;network developer&#x2019;, maintaining the networks quality and incentivising maximum contribution. LEAN focuses on supporting actual communities in developing their members, teams and organizations. Organisations like the EA Stiftung, EA Czechia, or EA London support CEA locally by complementing its efforts with services that are difficult to tailor to local realities from afar. Local groups develop the capacity to optimally feed into the network depending on their biggest possible value add. Communities take care of its members on a human level and build the badass, specialised core teams that EA needs for maximum impact work.</p>\n<p>Of course, this is fully conditional on finding the right people, communities and organisations that should be part of the network. That&#x2019;s a discussion for another time.</p></body></html>", "user": {"username": "konrad"}}, {"_id": "Zwjy4YPccnf8b4WCo", "title": "Berkeley REACH Supporters Update: September 2018", "postedAt": "2018-09-18T05:29:11.432Z", "htmlBody": "<html><body><p>https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/zevenyZ4NNktwC2Xu/berkeley-reach-supporters-update-september-2018</p></body></html>", "user": {"username": "sdspikes"}}, {"_id": "cimFBQbpjntoBAKCq", "title": "Is it better to be a wild rat or a factory farmed cow? A systematic method for comparing animal welfare.", "postedAt": "2018-09-17T23:55:51.869Z", "htmlBody": "<html><body><p><em><strong>TLDR</strong>: We looked at a lot of different systems to compare welfare and ended up combining a few common ones into a <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dWzh0Se0nhbPxe2Ye3o-tr3BoOBtdiCbMkpPuw2rBFE/edit#gid=0\">weighted animal welfare index</a> (or welfare points for short). We think this system captures a broad range of ethical considerations and should be applicable across a wide range of both farm and wild animals in a way that allows us to compare interventions.</em>&#xA0;&#xA0;</p>\n<p>The goal of Charity Entrepreneurship is to compare different charitable interventions and actions so that new, strong charities can be founded. One of the necessary steps in such a process is having a way to compare different animals in different conditions. For example, how does moving a chicken from a battery cage to cage free compare welfare wise for the chicken, or how does giving up red meat, thus resulting in one less cow being brought into existence, compare to an insect dying more humanely because of a change in which insecticide is used. These are complex questions surrounded by both ethical and epistemic uncertainty. In the health community, DALYs have become fairly common and established as a metric. Sadly, there is not the same level of consensus within the animal rights community. We expected there would be multiple competing systems, so we first outlined what we would look for within a system to assess its helpfulness to us. This could be described as the &#x201C;goal&#x201D; or purpose of the metric. Of course, the fundamental goal is to help us evaluate different possible actions, but more specifically, we broke down what we were looking for in the criteria below.&#xA0;&#xA0;</p>\n<p><em>Underlying goals of metrics</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Proxies&#x2019; ethical value accuracy</li>\n<ul>\n<li>Strength of correlation between the metric and ethical value</li>\n<li>Encapsulation - captures a broad range of what is important</li>\n<li>Directness</li>\n<li>Gamability</li>\n</ul>\n<li>Cross-applicability</li>\n<ul>\n<li>Cross-intervention applicability&#xA0;</li>\n<li>Cross-animal applicability&#xA0;</li>\n<li>Ethical robustness</li>\n<li>Externally understandable</li>\n<li>External precedent of use</li>\n</ul>\n<li>Operationalizability</li>\n<ul>\n<li>Amenable to numerical quantification&#xA0;</li>\n<li>Ease/speed of use</li>\n<li>Objectiveness&#xA0;</li>\n<li>Generates few false positives or false negatives</li>\n<li>Intuitive to work with</li>\n<li>Easy to collect</li>\n<li>Easy to explain</li>\n</ul>\n</ul>\n<p>After establishing what we were looking for, the next step was to take a look at all current systems and see if any of them was conducive or could be used partly by an organization like ours. We ended up finding quite a wide range.</p>\n<h2>EA community</h2>\n<p>We first looked within the EA community, since there had been some solid attempts at quantification and the ones below are just a few of many examples.</p>\n<p><em>Within the EA community</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.getguesstimate.com/models/9590?token=sSMogCCGAhX_PxpHvvOxEp_lP376AAmzJ3YL2XKYMqebUal1E8zL86vNw7-ZQRcPFKDkKAaATiN3g9CDuj5XVA\">Farmed Animal Years Averted</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.getguesstimate.com/models/9604?token=CkrbzlMlrvv6XJOuZ3wmLJwtvnkJoD2aIY79V6DuAe3Wk5t0WP-q4O5Eu9eDuL-jzqz5w1I_YARjtTakfkWesA\">Years of Suffering Averted</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/initial-grants-support-corporate-cage-free-reforms\">Hens Spared a Year / $</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/ea/1pn/animal_equality_showed_that_advocating_for_diet/\">Pigs saved / $</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://everydayutilitarian.com/essays/how-much-does-it-cost-to-buy-a-vegetarian/\">$ per vegetarian year</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://reducing-suffering.org/humane-insecticides/\">Death experiences prevented per dollar</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.utility.farm/words/adoption-level-advocacy\">Wild animals impacted per $1000</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://reducing-suffering.org/how-rainforest-beef-production-affects-wild-animal-suffering/#Putting_it_all_together\">Total suffering reduced&#xA0; / lb beef bought</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://reducing-suffering.org/cost-effectiveness-comparison-for-different-ways-to-reduce-insect-suffering/\">Insect-years of suffering prevented / US$</a></li>\n<li>Using the metrics that welfare standards use e.g. <a href=\"https://agreenerworld.org/certifications/animal-welfare-approved/\">AWA</a> and <a href=\"https://globalanimalpartnership.org/\">GAP</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>These metrics were generally very hard, quantified, and often even explicitly cost-effectiveness focused. Sadly, they were also extremely specific and not built for generalization across different interventions and charities. Thus, for our purposes, they were more helpful as inspiration for the factors to consider, or standards that we would want to be able to measure, rather than for practical cross-intervention use.</p>\n<p><em>Biology-based markers</em></p>\n<p>The next set of metrics we looked at was biology-based markers. We had some background knowledge about cortisol readings as a measure of stress and hoped that we would find other objective markers that could make up part of a more inclusive system and add some objectivity to other soft systems. Some of the ones we considered (although, there are many other possible biological indicators) are listed below.&#xA0;&#xA0;</p>\n<p><em>Biology-based markers</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Cortisol</li>\n<li>Dopamine</li>\n<li>Endocrine changes</li>\n<li>Circulating catecholamines and corticosteroids</li>\n<li>Death rate</li>\n<li>Behavior changes</li>\n<li>Visible injury rate&#xA0;</li>\n<li>Reduced life expectancy</li>\n<li>Impaired growth</li>\n<li>Impaired reproduction</li>\n<li>Body damage</li>\n<li>Disease&#xA0;</li>\n<li>Immunosuppression</li>\n<li>Adrenal activity</li>\n<li>Behavior anomalies</li>\n<li>Self-narcotization</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Biological markers were useful in that they were much less subjective than other metrics but sadly, it was also very hard to find consistent data across animals on many of them (with the death rate being a notable exception). We ended up thinking these would make up a part of a larger system, but even an index of them would not be inclusive enough to cover all the possible sources of animal welfare situations that could occur.&#xA0;</p>\n<h2>Academic measures of quality</h2>\n<p>The third type of system we considered was &#x201C;academic measures of quality of life&#x201D;. <a href=\"https://was-research.org/paper/fit-happy-measure-wild-animal-suffering/#Miscellaneous_Assessment_Strategies\">WAS research had a great summary</a> of many of the different systems used, but we also looked outside of their research for other possible systems.</p>\n<p><em>Academic measures&#xA0;</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Five freedoms</li>\n<li>The Five Domains model</li>\n<li>Five Provisions model</li>\n<li>Botreau&#x2019;s twelve criteria</li>\n<li>McMillan&#x2019;s five elements, which play a fundamental role in quality of life</li>\n<li>Fraser&#x2019;s animal welfare&#x2019;s four core values</li>\n<li>Webster&#x2019;s animal welfare&#x2019;s three questions</li>\n<li>Taylor and Mills&#x2019;s domains for assessing companion animal&#x2019;s quality of life:</li>\n<li>Swaisgood&#x2019;s ten motivational theories which have currency among animal-welfare researchers</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Many of these systems were beautifully comprehensive and described metrics and criteria in such a way that it would be cross-applicable to a wide range of animals across a wide range of conditions. Some even specified different grade levels (although, these were generally not numeric) to provide more consistency across reports. It seemed possible that some researchers would have already used these systems, though sadly, we did not find much research showcasing the modern practical use of these systems. The main drawback of these systems was their subjectivity. Even with the ones with specific grade levels, a lot would be left up to the evaluator about making calls between one system and another: for example, how does not being fed for several days, while being otherwise perfectly fed, compare to semi-chronic but low level hunger. Overall, we took a large number of elements of our system from the five domains model, which felt like the most extensively quantified and broad one of these models.&#xA0;</p>\n<h2>Systems used in global poverty</h2>\n<p>Next, we considered the current systems used in global poverty alleviation and other cause assessment areas. We thought it might be possible to modify one of these metrics to be usefully applicable to animals.&#xA0;</p>\n<p><em>Modified poverty based metrics</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Animal QALYs</li>\n<li>Animal DALYs</li>\n<li>Animal Income</li>\n<li>Animal subjective well-being estimates</li>\n<li>Equivalent lives saved</li>\n<li>Preference from behind the veil of ignorance&#xA0;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Generally, these metrics were too unapplicable (e.g. income) or would have required considerably more time to modify and put into the animal welfare context (e.g. DALYs do not have a way to have a net negative existence, which is a key consideration in the case of factory farmed animals).</p>\n<h2>Creating our own system</h2>\n<p>Finally, we considered creating a cross-applicable system from scratch</p>\n<p><em>Our own ideas for possible systems</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>SAD - suffering-adjusted life-day</li>\n<li>Sentience-adjusted suffering years</li>\n<li>Net negative lives averted&#xA0;</li>\n<li>Total world net expected value&#xA0;</li>\n<li>Numerical criteria for animals&#x2019; quality of life, e.g. a -100 to 100 rating</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We did end up using some of the ideas drawn from considering this option but, overall, found that taking elements from other systems would both increase quality and reduce the time that we would otherwise spend on creating a new system from scratch.&#xA0;</p>\n<h2>Results: an inclusive index&#xA0;</h2>\n<p>We ended up putting many of these systems onto a spreadsheet and comparing them on the original metric criteria we had derived. Some criteria ended up getting narrowed down. For example, we combined various biological markers into a single &#x201C;biological markers&#x201D; category. Some criteria were made more numerical and cross-comparable, for example, by translating the 5 domains model into number-based scores, instead of grades. Other elements were given their own category and weighting based on how well they met the top line criteria (for example, death rate). Most criteria were ruled out as redundant or not helpful for our purposes.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>We ended up with 8 criteria with an importance weighting for each. Combined, they added to a range of +100 (an ideal life) to -100 (a perfectly unideal life) with 0 representing uncertainty about the life being net positive or negative. Each area can have positive or negative welfare scores and is to be rated independently, giving a more robust cluster approach to the overall endline score. The weighting of each factor is different, depending on how well it scored on our original metric criteria. For example, death rate gets a relatively higher weighting (20 welfare points) than our index of other biological markers (4 welfare points) due to its ease to work with and its clearer relation to direct animal suffering (e.g. we are more confident that animals with very high and painful death rates will correlate more strongly with a life not worth living than the more abstract biological markers will).&#xA0;&#xA0;</p>\n<p>Factors we ended up using:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Death rate/reason - 20</li>\n<li>Human preference from behind the veil of ignorance - 20</li>\n<li>Disease/injury/functional impairment - 17</li>\n<li>Thirst/hunger/malnutrition - 15</li>\n<li>Anxiety/fear/pain/distress - 15</li>\n<li>Environmental challenge - 5</li>\n<li>Index of Biological markers - 4</li>\n<li>Behavioral/interactive restriction - 4</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Our <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dWzh0Se0nhbPxe2Ye3o-tr3BoOBtdiCbMkpPuw2rBFE/edit#gid=0\">full spreadsheet with factors, scores, and metric criteria scores</a> gives a deeper sense of why different areas were given the weighting they were, as well as a narrative explanation of what a negative, middling, and positive score would look like in each category.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>Overall, we felt like this system gave us a good balance between both the more subjective metrics that could capture more data and the harder metrics that were more objective. We feel that this system could be used across a wide range of both animals and interventions, and lead to cross-comparable results.</p></body></html>", "user": {"username": "Joey"}}, {"_id": "nstKfMKh36Xdjsezm", "title": "EA Grants applications are now open", "postedAt": "2018-09-17T18:15:55.467Z", "htmlBody": "<html><body><p><span>I&#x2019;m announcing that the Centre for Effective Altruism&#x2019;s (CEA) EA Grants project has now been reopened for public applications.

When we began our hiring round in the summer we then advertised for someone to take on our </span><a href=\"https://www.centreforeffectivealtruism.org/careers/ea-grants-evaluator/\"><span>EA Grants Evaluator</span></a><span> role full time. As a stop-gap measure we decided to evaluate EA Grants on a referral basis, and we distributed links to the application form to some members of the EA community whose judgement we trust. This had the benefit of meaning we had to review fewer applications and so could run the project with less staff capacity.</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>Through the referral process, we&#x2019;ve agreed to fund 22 grants for a total of ~$850,000, using substantially less staff time than the 2017 EA Grants round. However, the referral system has the significant downside of making it less likely that we encounter projects from people outside of our networks. It also meant that some potentially promising applicants may have failed to develop projects that would have been good candidates for EA Grants funding, because they didn&#x2019;t know that EA Grants funding was still available.</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>Our ultimate goal is to keep EA Grants open for anyone to apply on an ongoing basis. We&#x2019;re currently looking to hire an EA Grants Evaluator to oversee the evaluation process and to give us enough capacity to reliably keep EA Grants open for applications. However, even with a full time EA Grants Evaluator on staff, when we reopen EA Grants to the public, we expect to get an initial surge of applications that might prove too much for us to evaluate in a timely manner.</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>To deal with this concern and to accelerate the timeline for a public EA Grants application, we&#x2019;ve decided to open EA Grants to the public, but to restrict the number of applications that move from the first stage of the evaluation process (the short application) to the second stage of the process (the long application) to 100. This should ensure that we don&#x2019;t end up with more applications than we can evaluate in a timely manner. We plan to notify applicants that we suspect might have advanced without the restriction and ask them to reapply at a later date.</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<h2>What happens when I apply?</h2>\n<p><span>The application process for EA Grants now has five basic stages:</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>1. Short application</span><br><span>2. Long application</span><br><span>3. Reference check</span><br><span>4. Interview</span><br><span>5. Final decision</span></p>\n<p><span>Applications are open now and will close on Sunday, October 14. We expect to begin evaluating applications before the application period ends, so it&#x2019;s advantageous to submit your application sooner rather than later.</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>Between October 19 and 26, we will notify the top 100 applicants and ask them to complete our long application. As mentioned above, we&#x2019;re restricting the number of applications that we evaluate further to ensure that we have sufficient capacity to perform the evaluations. This means that we expect to reject some applicants who we think might have been plausible candidates for funding after further evaluation. After the long application we will select the top applicants for interviews, reference checks and, potentially, funding. Given the stages required to assess grant applications, we expect to make final decisions in early December. We&#x2019;ll keep applicants up to date on the progress of their application by email.</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<h2>Changes from the previous EA Grants round</h2>\n<p><span>The biggest change over the 2017 round is that we broke up the application form into two stages: the short application and the long application. In the 2017 round, we noticed that many of the applications could be rejected after a brief review because they weren&#x2019;t focused on a plausibly high priority area or because the applicant lacked any signs of alignment with EA values. We also suspect that some plausible applicants failed to apply because the application form was particularly daunting to complete.</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>The short application is designed to give us enough information to determine if an application is plausible. For applications that aren&#x2019;t plausible, the short application reduces the time they spend on applying for an EA Grant. For applications that are plausible, the short application allows us to send a positive signal about the application before asking the applicant to spend more time on the application process. For the current application round, the number of applicants that can be moved to the long application will be restricted to 100, but in the future we plan to accept all applications that seem to be above our funding bar. </span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>We&#x2019;ve also added a request for three references to the long application. We&#x2019;ll email each reference once the application is complete and ask them to fill out a brief survey about their relationship to the applicant. In particularly close funding decisions we may also call the references.</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<h2>Evaluation criteria</h2>\n<p><span>EA Grants applications are challenging to evaluate. We accept applications in any cause area, and we accept requests for many different types of projects and funding amounts ranging from requests for a few thousand dollars to travel to a conference to requests for a hundred thousand dollars to start a new organization. In addition, because the average amount of funding requested is small, it often doesn&#x2019;t make sense to spend as much time as we&#x2019;d like on evaluating each request.</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>The wide range of possible projects means that we expect to use somewhat different evaluation criteria for different types of projects, and that we expect to evaluate larger funding requests much more thoroughly than smaller funding requests. However, we expect the basic evaluation framework to remain similar across projects.</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>Roughly speaking, we evaluate projects on the basis of three key questions.</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>How valuable is this project?</span></p>\n<p><span>First, we look at how valuable the project is likely to be if it goes well. Roughly speaking there are three ways a project can go well: (1) the project itself produces some positive result; (2) the person running the project gains some valuable skills or experience; (3) some useful knowledge is created as a result of the project.</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>Ideally projects produce value along multiple dimensions, but we&#x2019;re open to funding projects that produce value only on one dimension. For example, we may sometimes choose to fund projects where we are unsure of the object-level value of the project, if we think the project will produce useful knowledge for the community. While we didn&#x2019;t fund this particular project, an example of a past project we consider worthwhile for the information it produced was Charity Science&#x2019;s </span><a href=\"http://www.charityscience.com/operations-details/6-month-review-of-the-grant-writing-experiment\"><span>early work on grantwriting for effective charities</span></a><span>, which did not achieve its goal of raising funds but did provide useful information to other EAs about whether grantwriting on behalf of other organizations was a viable project.</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>Is this person well-suited to this project?</span></p>\n<p><span>We also look at whether the applicant is a good person to run the project. This breaks down into whether this is a good person to run an EA Grants project in general, and whether they seem suited to this particular project.</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>The general characteristics we look for in EA Grants applications are understanding of, and commitment to, the principles of effective altruism, demonstrated ability and drive, demonstrated ability to run projects autonomously, and overall good judgement. For evaluating fit between the applicant and a particular project, we look for evidence that the applicant has the skills and knowledge likely to be necessary to complete it.</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>What happens otherwise?</span></p>\n<p><span>Finally, we attempt to roughly figure out the counterfactuals to us funding the project. In particular, we look at what the person would do if the project isn&#x2019;t funded and whether they&#x2019;d be able to access funding without our assistance. If we think that a person&#x2019;s alternative plans are better than the project, then we may discuss that with the applicant. If we think the applicant can raise money easily from other sources, we may encourage them to do that instead.</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>Asking what happens otherwise should also predispose us in favor of funding people that are less well known in the EA community or funding projects that fall outside of established cause areas, as these projects are significantly less likely to be funded otherwise.</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<h2>What kinds of projects should apply?</h2>\n<p><span>EA Grants has an intentionally broad mandate. We&#x2019;re open to funding any project in any cause area. We expect to mostly fund less-established projects without easy access to other funding sources and we generally expect to commit less than $130,000 per project, although we may make exceptions in some cases.</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>One area we&#x2019;re not currently funding is directly covering tuition expenses for people who want to go to grad school, although we are willing to fund related expenses, like living expenses to take a high-impact internship.</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>The projects that we funded in 2017 are </span><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/1/d/1iBy--zMyIiTgybYRUQZIm11WKGQZcixaCmIaysRmGvk/edit?usp=sharing\"><span>available here</span></a><span>.

After a website redesign about a year ago it was removed for technical reasons and bringing it back hasn&#x2019;t yet hit the top of the tech team&#x2019;s list of priorities. As a result people haven&#x2019;t been able to follow how GWWC is doing.</p>\n<p>Well, I bring good news! Despite having much less direct attention paid to it than it used to receive, membership continues to grow at a healthy pace. In fact a surprisingly healthy pace (click for a higher res version):</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/thCpVYG.png\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/thCpVYG.png\"></a></p>\n<p>Since CEA stopped focussing on growing GWWC&#x2019;s membership in mid-January 2017, it has attracted an additional 1,152 members.</p>\n<p>That compares to 1,528 over the same period before mid-January 2017. By this measure deprioritizing GWWC has only slowed the pace of membership growth by 25%.</p>\n<p>We can look at the change in trajectory some other ways too. GWWC&#x2019;s membership seemed to be growing faster than linearly up to mid-January 2018, but linearly since then. If we model the growth as a second order polynomial - remember your quadratics from high school - growth is down a third. If we model it as a third order polynomial - which I think is the best fit for the data up to January 2018 - it&#x2019;s down about half. If we model it - somewhat ambitiously - as an exponential, it&#x2019;s down more like 70%.</p>\n<p>A few other observations:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We can see that it took a while from when GWWC hired its first staff member for this to pay off in higher membership growth. I was around working at GWWC for the first half of this, and it looks to me like a pretty classic case of it taking time to develop &#x2018;product-market fit&#x2019; as Y Combinator calls it. It took time to learn i) what would encourage the sorts of people who would stick with the pledge to actually sign up, ii) what kind of research or other content would attract the kind of readers who want to take the pledge, iii) how to make best use of local GWWC groups, iv) plenty of other things besides.</li>\n<li>The impact of the three holiday season pledge drives in 2014, 2015 and 2016 is very visible.</li>\n<li>The period when a reorganised&#xA0;Centre for Effective Altruism&#xA0;as a whole was focussed on growing GWWC&#x2019;s membership - the third holiday drive from October 2016 to January 2017 - was quite successful. It resulted in 80% more membership growth than the second best four-month period.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Growth not slowing down as much as as I would have predicted it would seems like evidence that previous efforts to grow GWWC&#x2019;s membership were not having as much impact as I thought.</p>\n<p>This doesn&#x2019;t gel with my personal experience working there in 2012 and 2013.</p>\n<p>Firstly, we can see what membership growth without any effort to draw attention to the pledge looks like in the very gradual increase over 2009-2012. This was generated by organic spread through social networks, occasional news stories, and some internet search traffic. Only 35 people joined in 2010 and 98 in 2011 - an 18th and a 6th of the rate today, respectively.</p>\n<p>Secondly, the impact of the holiday campaigns in 2014, 15 and 16 speaks to the effectiveness of encouraging people to make an active decision on whether to join or not. Note that without an active campaign, there was no noticeable spike in pledges during 2012, 13 or 17,&#xA0;which shows&#xA0;that&#xA0;it was these efforts rather than&#xA0;some general&#xA0;&apos;holiday season&#xA0;effect&apos;.</p>\n<p>An alternative explanation is that GWWC&#x2019;s larger membership base means it now spreads organically through social networks much faster than it did in the past.</p>\n<p>The background rate of people finding out about GWWC through its website hasn&#x2019;t much changed: since January 2017 the number of new users visiting the site has declined only 15%, despite there being little new content. This reflects the large fraction of people coming in through search traffic, which has been roughly stable.</p>\n<p>Another alternative interpretation is that efforts to promote the ideas of effective altruism more broadly - without encouraging people to join GWWC specifically - may be creating GWWC members at quite a high rate, and higher than we saw&#xA0;back in&#xA0;the early days.</p>\n<p>Whatever&#x2019;s going on, don&#x2019;t count GWWC out.

Islands have long been discussed as refuges from global catastrophes; this paper will evaluate them systematically, discussing both the positives and negatives of islands as refuges. There are examples where isolated human communities have survived for thousands of years on places like Easter Island. Islands could provide protection against many low-level risks, first of all bio-risks. However, they are vulnerable to tsunamis, bird transmitted diseases, and other risks. In this article, we explore how to use the advantages of islands for survival of global catastrophes. The large number of islands on Earth, and their diverse conditions increase the chance that one of them will provide protection from a catastrophe. Additionally, we could increase this protection if an island were used as a base for a nuclear submarine refuge (the &#x201C;Yellow submarine&#x201D; project), and/or combined with underground bunkers, and/or extremely long-term data storage. We explore the requirements for survival on islands, their vulnerabilities, and ways to mitigate and adapt to risks. We look at several existing islands, suitable for the survival of different risks, timing, and budgets. To end, we will compare islands with different types of refuges, and look for places similar to islands, which could also provide protection.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p>This table from the article presents the relation between different catastrophe&#xA0;sizes and needed refuges.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/g1K0JUE.jpg\" alt=\"Relation between catastrophes size and refuges types\"></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p></body></html>", "user": {"username": "turchin"}}, {"_id": "tSCnGyP5wpSuEmRDQ", "title": "EA needs a cause prioritization journal", "postedAt": "2018-09-12T22:40:52.153Z", "htmlBody": "<html><body><p>It&apos;s about time that someone started publishing a journal for cause prioritization arguments. It may have open peer review or a traditional formal process, it may come from a reputable academic press or it may be an in-house thing with zero credibility to the outside world, it may publish regular papers or weird things like argument maps and adversarial collaborations, I make no claims about how to navigate these details, but there needs to be a journal.</p>\n<p>I don&apos;t think this claim needs much special argument; I expect that many people&apos;s reaction to this will be &quot;gee whiz, of course that&apos;s a good idea.&quot; We think cause prioritization is a serious new issue, we should have a venue to publish about it, pretty straightforward right? Every new field gets a journal, and the review and publication process improves article quality. Still, I will develop the argument for an EA journal in greater detail, and hopefully make it clear that it is worth the time and money required to run it.</p>\n<p>EA has developed a significant body of knowledge spread across a variety of spaces. Some of it is fine as common knowledge and blog posts; simple ideas, which are easy to accept and communicate. Or they may be temporary practical issues, like evaluation of a particular charity, that don&apos;t last long enough to warrant the special attention and timelessness of being put into a publication. Yet cause prioritization arguments are more conceptual, they are important, and they need to be fleshed out with greater rigor than they have been. <a href=\"https://nickbostrom.com/astronomical/waste.html\">This paper</a> for instance has been relied upon for ages, yet nothing has really followed on from it. There has been no quantitative modeling or sensitivity analysis, there has been no thorough comparison of risk reduction versus growth acceleration, and without that we aren&apos;t getting closer to really settling the issue of whether existential risk really can be presumed to be our biggest priority in the long run.</p>\n<p>We occasionally have discussions that move past the basic old cause prioritization arguments, but that is transient; many arguments are left in a form that is impossible to summarize and build upon, then forgotten. Then we devote most of our time to bickering about the community, because we are not being fed enough difficult new intellectual content to keep our minds occupied. We think that all the cause prioritization arguments were pretty much fleshed out already, so we assume that the issue is settled and treat causes like ideologies or identities rather than hypotheses.</p>\n<p>So not a lot of real progress is actually being made on the core EA project. I think the situation is actually very poor by academic standards. We need to encourage people to do serious work on cause prioritization, make sure that it is rigorous, and make sure that it is in a format that lends itself to further work. A good way to address this and other problems is to create a journal for it.</p>\n<p><strong>Existing journals aren&apos;t suitable.</strong></p>\n<p>First, they are rarely interested in the questions of cause prioritization. While journals <em>may</em> be interested in cost-effectiveness arguments for particular efforts in their particular field (e.g. https://www.academia.edu/34953571/Cost-effectiveness_of_interventions_for_alternate_food_in_the_United_States_to_address_agricultural_catastrophes), I can think of none which would care about rigorous comparisons between very different causes. For not only is cause prioritization interdisciplinary among different scientific fields, but it also relates to ethics and decision theory, meaning that it crosses a set of domains so wide that no typical journal will encompass it. <em>Utilitas</em> can be amenable, but it won&apos;t work for non-utilitarian EA arguments, or arguments over moral uncertainty.</p>\n<p>Second, publishing to an external audience requires explaining or defending lots of basic premises and background that may be common in an EA audience. The results can be seen in these two papers (https://commons.pacificu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1573&amp;context=eip / https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10677-013-9433-4). They both argue for the viability of certain EA activities, yet the most of their space is taken up by issues which were widely considered settled or uninteresting in the EA community at the time of publication.</p>\n<p>Third, common scientific norms revolve around frequentist statistics and typically require proven results in order to be considered interesting; everything else is relegated to the same bucket of &quot;plausible&quot;. This makes it difficult to make a scientific argument for the prioritization of some uncertain causes over others. In EA, we are much more comfortable with subjective Bayesian epistemology, we are more comfortable acting on the basis of uncertain possibilities, and we are very interested in knowing just how likely or unlikely a possibility is. With our own journal, it will be easier for us to publish a paper that properly models all the uncertain parts of the equation that are necessary to complete a full cause prioritization argument. Subjective Bayesian methodology does get published in reputable journals, it&apos;s just rare - most academics are less comfortable with it.</p>\n<p>Fourth, involving EAs in the peer review will ensure that papers are appropriately written to target EA criteria and dodge the likely EA counterarguments. Even though the author of a draft would be an EA, she may have a blind spot regarding the way that other EAs think about the issue.</p>\n<p><strong>It will lend notability to our movement and ideas.</strong></p>\n<p>Having a journal on a subject is a small step for establishing it as a widely-acknowledged legitimate field of study. It encourages other people to cite the works in their own literature and take them seriuosly. To be sure, a new journal may not be noticed at all, and I don&apos;t know what it takes to make a journal seem properly reputable as opposed to something like those creationist journals where they are just publishing whatever fits their point of view so nobody pays attention to them. But anything would be technically better than having these ideas be put up on the internet by their own authors with no review or publication at all. To be sure, in practice, a very bad journal would be worse than nothing because of the reputation risk, but I doubt that we would screw things up that much.</p>\n<p><strong>It will create opportunities for outsiders to contribute.</strong></p>\n<p>Again assuming that it is sufficiently reputable, it could encourage people outside EA to weigh in on our questions, because now it means that they will get a publication. A major benefit here is that the review process, being led by EAs, will help them translate their ideas into a form that is more suitable for us. As it stands, people on the outside who try to attack EA cause priorities often have a pretty poor grasp of what does or doesn&apos;t work as an argument in the EA framework, and a poor grasp of our likely counterarguments. This problem persists in academic publications that comment on EA causes. It would obviously be much better to hash out these things pre-publication, so that they can provide us with more useful arguments.</p>\n<p><strong>We have enough output to sustain a journal.</strong></p>\n<p>Think about all the things being written by individuals in the community on forums and their personal websites, the blogs and reports from all our organizations (Givewell, Open Phil, ACE, FLI...), and the papers that are being published in academic journals by EAs. Much of it is very seriously thought out. With all this effort, just a bit of emphasis of cause prioritization will enable journal issues to be put together within an acceptable length of time.</p>\n<p><strong>Hey</strong><strong>, what about academic incentives!? Peer review is broken! It&apos;s all status signaling! Think about publication bias! Think about the replication crisis! Remember the Sokal Affair??? Etc, etc.</strong></p>\n<p>However great these problems are, surely the practice of spreading arguments across Facebook walls, podcasts, and blog posts has them or others to a greater degree. And that&apos;s the state of EA thought on cause prioritization. In any case, EAs know enough about these issues, and are sufficiently free of the need to pander to establishment institutions, that we can presumably design a journal mechanism that is better than the norm.</p></body></html>", "user": {"username": "kbog"}}, {"_id": "KMzTupG6ZJQ5YFc3M", "title": "Making Organisations More Welcoming", "postedAt": "2018-09-12T21:52:52.530Z", "htmlBody": "<p>I\u2019ve been grateful over the years to notice ways in which the EA organisations I\u2019ve been part of have worked hard to be more inclusive. By being inclusive, I mean cultivating an atmosphere where people feel equally comfortable sharing their opinions, where work/burdens fall equally on different people and where everyone feels at ease with each other. I often feel that the EA orgs I\u2019ve been at have tried harder at this and had more success than non-EA workplaces I\u2019ve been part of. As someone who\u2019s naturally shy, I\u2019ve substantially benefited from this. I wanted to share some of the strategies which have seemed helpful to me. They\u2019re often non-obvious and even when known they\u2019re easy to forget, so I thought they seemed worth sharing. I also wanted to share this to express some of my gratitude to all the colleagues and friends who have suggested, researched and implemented the techniques below. I\u2019d love for others to share (in the comments or other posts) techniques that have been helpful for them or examples of welcoming cultures they\u2019ve been grateful for.</p><p>This article reflects my personal views only, not those of my employer (Global Priorities Institute) and draws on experience from a number of different roles in different organisations.</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Meetings</strong></p><p>To start with something simple, here are a few ways in which meetings can be run to try to make sure that all voices are heard:</p><p>-          <strong>Choose a moderator</strong>: Particularly in large meetings, it\u2019s worth assigning a chair or moderator, and working out a system for all participants to be able to register that they would like to speak (eg a shared googledoc that everyone has in front of them with the chat box open). The chair has the responsibility of ensuring that each person gets a chance to speak when they have indicated they would like to. This lowers the cost of contributing for shy members of the group.</p><p>-          <strong>Rotate who minutes</strong>: It\u2019s harder to contribute to a meeting if you\u2019re minuting. Often, the same people regularly volunteer, with other members feeling that they don\u2019t do as good a job at minuting and therefore never volunteering. To make sure everyone is equally able to participate in meetings, have a fixed rotation of who takes minutes, or bring someone into the meeting specifically to take minutes.</p><p>-          <strong>Brainstorm individually:</strong> When brainstorming new ideas, it can be worth getting people to silently think about their own ideas and then write them into a shared document. This avoids anchoring, or people feeling that they ought to suggest only ideas that are similar to / build on those of others.</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Building a welcoming team</strong></p><p>-          <strong>Mentorship</strong>: Assigning all staff members a mentor who is outside their chain of command (ideally someone who has been at the organisation a while) could help to give them someone to go to with questions or concerns, without worrying that they may be penalised for doing so.</p><p>-          <strong>Sharing emotional labour</strong>: Some people naturally notice and take responsibility for work which benefits the whole team, such as organising team dinners and organising leaving parties. This can be experienced by those doing it as being under an additional burden. Those who find it more difficult notice such things can help by explicitly volunteering to take on jobs suggested by others: make clear that you would like to organise dinners, buy leaving presents etc, and welcome suggestions from others of when it would be appropriate to do so (along with any advice they have on doing it).</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Growing a team</strong></p><p>When recruiting is perhaps the most natural time to pay attention to how diverse a team is, and how to increase a team\u2019s diversity. But given that it\u2019s illegal to discriminate on the basis of gender, race, and other protected characteristics, it\u2019s not necessarily easy to know how improve hiring to be more welcoming for candidates who are currently under-represented on your team. Here are a few things I\u2019ve come across which have seemed useful in this regard:</p><p>-          <strong>Gender Decoder(http://gender-decoder.katmatfield.com/)</strong>: This piece of software allows you to run a job description/advert through it, and tells you what language in the description will appeal disproportionately to women or men. It will also suggest more neutral wording, or wording that appeals to the opposite gender.</p><p>-          <strong>Brainstorming lists of underrepresented candidates</strong>: It can be easier to come up with new examples of a type which are similar to the examples you were already thinking about. That means if your staff is already comprised mostly of philosophers, when you sit down to consider who to recruit you might naturally come up with a list of more philosophers, even if you would actually like to be hiring more (eg) biologists. A useful thing to do in a case like this can be specifically asking yourself what <em>biologists</em> you know who it would be good to recruit.</p><p>-          <strong>Proactively reach out</strong>: People vary widely in how confident they are about applying for roles, and people who are currently underrepresented in a field may be particularly likely to be underconfident. So if you have a list of candidates you would like to apply who have a different profile from your current staff, it\u2019s likely to be worth reaching out to them personally to discuss the job with them and encourage them to apply.</p><p>-          <strong>Balancing interview panels</strong>: It\u2019s widely considered best practice to have somewhat balanced hiring panels, containing at least people with differing skill sets and of different genders. That can both help in increasing the information used for choosing candidates (because people who are different are likely to pick up on different things), and in making candidates feel more at ease in the interview. If you do this, it\u2019s worth keeping an eye on whether there are any people who are disproportionately often asked to serve on hiring panels, and think about whether there are ways to make doing so easier and less time consuming for them.</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Shaping a culture </strong></p><p>I tried in the previous sections to give concrete, implementable suggestions. But there are a lot of things that feel hard to pin down but are crucial to forming a friendly, inclusive culture. What matters most for a person feeling comfortable in a team will differ widely depending on the person, so I thought I would just list a few of the things I\u2019ve appreciated in the past:</p><p>-          <strong>Being respectful about people\u2019s limits</strong>: In atmospheres where everyone is pushing themselves to keep doing more to help the world, it\u2019s been invaluable to me to feel that the people around me are truly understanding of each other\u2019s limits. These limits are often very different \u2013 some people work harder than others, some spend more than others, some differ in their diets. Knowing that those around you aren\u2019t judging you for your daily choices and actions, even when they make entirely dissimilar ones, makes all the difference.</p><p>-          <strong>Believing in each other</strong>: Far from having to push to be taken seriously in taking on new challenges, I\u2019ve often been encouraged by others to take them on. Belief in and encouragement of others can allow us to have a community where people aren\u2019t held back by lack of confidence. (Then we need to support each other in taking on those challenges!)</p><p>-          <strong>Being happy to hear feedback</strong>: I\u2019ve been so impressed by how open the people I\u2019ve met through effective altruism are to hearing feedback and how able to implement it. Humans working together is never going to be completely smooth sailing. But the waves are much easier to deal with knowing that if I (or someone else around me) feel(s) uncomfortable about something I can bring it up and we can figure out a solution together.</p><p>-          <strong>Putting in the time</strong>: Building up a caring culture is difficult and time consuming, so I\u2019m appreciative of all time and effort people in this community are putting into it. That might mean drawing up values for an organisation, and helping it stick to them. It might mean noticing things that could be irritating or alienating someone else on your team, and checking in with them in case they didn\u2019t want to be the one to bring it up. Or it might simply mean making clear that you\u2019re always there to help those around you if and when they need it. </p>", "user": {"username": "Michelle_Hutchinson"}}, {"_id": "mK8zDmod8qXtvjpQo", "title": "Book review: The Doomsday Machine", "postedAt": "2018-09-10T01:43:40.241Z", "htmlBody": "<p><em>The Doomsday Machine</em> by Daniel Ellsberg:</p><p>\u2026is a book about designing the end of the world as we know it,  chronologically through Daniel Ellsberg\u2019s career as a nuclear war  planner. It\u2019s well written, and Ellsberg makes a compelling hero. He\u2019s most famous for leaking the Pentagon Papers, government  documents on the Vietnam War that contributed to Nixon\u2019s resignation.  </p><p>This book came out of a second set of documents he photocopied and  intended to release after his trial for the Pentagon Papers, but lost in an act of nature. Early on, he describes this second planned leak as  the one that he fully expected to put him in jail for the rest of his  life, and how he felt the loss of those documents as both a tragedy for  the nation, and a blessing that allowed him to spend the following  decades beside his wife. It\u2019s the kind of thing that makes you glad  you\u2019re driving alone when your audiobook is making you tear up in the  desert along the Washington-Idaho border.</p><p>But all this just helps \u2013 the real meat of the book is in the systems he describes.</p><p>Let\u2019s talk about nuclear winter real quick. (My favorite line on  dates.) Ellsberg puts this at the end, which makes sense  chronologically, but it\u2019d be burying the lede for an x-risk focused  blog, so let\u2019s get it out there now:</p><p><em>All of our plans for cold war were decided before anyone knew about nuclear winter</em>.  I feel like I should capitalize that \u2013 Nuclear Winter. It\u2019s the  hypothesized event where nuclear explosions cause fired in cities that  launch so much ash into the stratosphere that it blots out the sun for  months and makes it impossible for plants to grow, killing most human  and large animal life. There\u2019s uncertainty around the specifics, but its  existence is generally agreed upon in the scientific community.</p><p>All US strategy during the early Cold War hinged on this idea of  \u201cgeneral war\u201d, an all-out nuclear exchange with Russia and China.  General War included dropping enormous nuclear weapons on literally  every single city in both Russia and China. Obviously, this is atrocious  enough \u2013 this level of calamity was expected to kill something like 20%  of the world\u2019s population at the time, mostly from fallout.</p><p>But every time general war was mentioned, a little voice in my head  yelled \u201cnuclear winter!\u201d \u2013 that the death toll is actually &gt;90% of  humanity, Americans, Russians, Chinese, and everyone else alike,  unbeknownst to everybody at the time. My loose impression is that  there\u2019s not substantial reason to believe that nuclear war planning  policy ever shifted to account for this fact.</p><p>Another quick takeaway: the US planned on making the first nuclear  strike on Russia and China throughout the Cold War. Today we have a  perception that the US only plans for using a second strike, but almost  the entirety of planning material is based on the supposition of the US  using nuclear weapons first. Again, there\u2019s little reason to suspect  this has changed now.</p><p>Through this book, I was repeatedly reminded of the Litany of Jai: <a href=\"https://blog.jaibot.com/\">Almost nobody is evil, almost everything is broken</a>.  The problems described in the book aren\u2019t the result of insanity or  complete carelessness, but instead a horrifying spider web of  incentives, laid unwittingly by people with limited goals and limited  knowledge. It\u2019s a sinister net of <a href=\"http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/\">multipolar traps</a>.  If you follow this web down, as Ellsberg does, you find yourself  looking into the yawning chasm of a nuclear apocalypse \u2013 not built on  purpose, but built nonetheless.</p><p>Let\u2019s look at how some of these tangled incentives lead us there.</p><hr class=\"dividerBlock\"/><ul><li><em>Branches of the military want high budgets.</em></li><li><em>Budget decisions are made based on intelligence from those branches.</em></li><li><em>Branches compete with each other for funding from Congress and other officials.</em></li></ul><p>                                                                             \u2193</p><ul><li>Various branches hugely overestimate enemy capacities.</li><li>E.g. the army reports extremely high Soviet ground force numbers.</li><li>The Air Force reports extremely high Soviet ICBM capacity.</li><li>Inter-branch coordination gets trampled.</li><li>There is no incentive for estimates or behavior that aligns with strategy or reality.</li></ul><hr class=\"dividerBlock\"/><ul><li><em>All military branches want to get in all-out war if/when it happens.</em></li></ul><p>                                                                             \u2193</p><ul><li>The Pacific Navy basically insists on attacking Asia alongside  Russia in all cases, because they want to be involved and don\u2019t just  want to attack minor Siberian targets \u201con the sidelines\u201d of The Big War.</li><li>Nuclear plans have Moscow area getting blanketed with hundreds of  nuclear bombs from all sides. \u201cHundreds of nuclear bombs\u201d is a phrase  that here and elsewhere means \u201ccalamitous overkill\u201d.</li></ul><hr class=\"dividerBlock\"/><ul><li><em>Military branches don\u2019t want to listen to civilian politicians.</em></li><li><em>Civilian politicians are powerful decision-makers.</em></li></ul><p>                                                                             \u2193</p><ul><li>Information is concealed, including from the president (for instance, the JSCP, which is the detailed plan for all-out war).</li><li>Military leaders just don\u2019t listen to civilians who outrank them  (e.g. in moving ships with nuclear warheads illegally stationed in  Japanese ports).</li><li>Civilian President Kennedy is politically obliged not to override  poor decisions made by President Eisenhower, the famous military  general.</li></ul><hr class=\"dividerBlock\"/><ul><li><em>Nuclear bomber pilots need to receive an authorized signal to enact plans for bombing Russian and Asian targets.</em></li><li><em>Air force planners want as little delay as possible in executing war plans once they get the order.</em></li><li><em>Air Force planners want to save time and effort.</em></li></ul><p>                                                                             \u2193</p><ul><li>Authorization codes are stored in plaintext in envelopes in each  plane, are the same between every plane, and are rarely changed.</li><li>Any pilot who realized this could easily lead their base in a nuclear strike, and almost certainly trigger all-out nuclear war.</li><li>There\u2019s no way in the target database to easily distinguish Russian  and Chinese targets, so everyone at Air Force bases assumes that if they  get the war order, they\u2019ll just drop nuclear weapons on everyone.

I&apos;m Toni, ACE&apos;s new director of research. I&apos;ve worked in ACE&apos;s research department for two and a half years, but I just stepped into the director role on July 31.</p>\n<p>On behalf of ACE, I&apos;d like to thank John Halstead for <a href=\"/ea/1so/concerns_with_ace_research/\">engaging</a> so thoughtfully with our work and for his dedication to improving the field of animal advocacy research. We value honest feedback, which is precisely why, several months ago, we invited Mr. Halstead and six other individuals to act as <a href=\"https://animalcharityevaluators.org/blog/some-updates-to-our-charity-evaluation-process-2018/\">consultants</a> during our charity evaluation process this year. I&apos;d also like to note my appreciation that Mr. Halstead shared his post with us prior to publishing it, which gave us the opportunity to consider his points and to draft this response for simultaneous publication.</p>\n<p>ACE would like to take this opportunity for a public exchange about our work to:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>explain our position on our older intervention research,</li>\n<li>clarify the relationship between our <a href=\"https://animalcharityevaluators.org/research/methodology/our-use-of-cost-effectiveness-estimates/\">cost-effectiveness estimates</a> (CEEs) and our &quot;all things considered&quot; point of view,</li>\n<li>clarify the relationship between our intervention reports and our charity reviews, and</li>\n<li>outline some of our research priorities for next year.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>My goal in this piece is not to address every point that Mr. Halstead raises,<sup><a href=\"#1\">[1]</a></sup> but rather to address what I believe is the underlying issue. It seems to me that Mr. Halstead&apos;s critique is largely based on: (i) a fundamental disagreement with ACE about the role that our CEEs <em>should</em> play in our decisions, and (ii) a misunderstanding about the role that our CEEs <em>do</em> play in our decisions. While we believe that our CEEs should (and do) play a very small role in our decisions, Mr. Halstead seems to believe that our CEEs should (and do) play a central role in our decisions. As a result, Mr. Halstead understandably has a very different idea than we do about which areas of our research we should prioritize.</p>\n<h2>Our Position on our Older Intervention Research</h2>\n<p>We are aware of some limitations of our older intervention research, and we agree with Mr. Halstead that ACE&apos;s 2014-2016 reports on corporate outreach, undercover investigations, humane education, and online ads are not up to our current standards. We recognize, for instance, that our previous use of &quot;pessimistic,&quot; &quot;realistic,&quot; and &quot;optimistic&quot; labels for our quantitative estimates was not ideal, and we did not sufficiently explain how we made or used those estimates. (In early 2017, we replaced our labeling strategy with the use of 90% <a href=\"https://animalcharityevaluators.org/research/methodology/subjective-confidence-interval/\">subjective confidence intervals</a>.) We are also aware that new research has become available since the publication of some of our older intervention reports. As such, they are in need of updating.</p>\n<p>One question that&apos;s been on my mind since I became ACE&apos;s director of research (about five weeks ago) is whether or not we should archive some of our older intervention reports until we are able to update them. Since ACE&apos;s research department is currently hard at work on our charity reviews, my initial plan was to wait until our reviews are published in November before making any major decisions about our intervention work. However, Mr. Halstead&apos;s post has led us to consider the value of our older reports sooner than planned, and we&apos;ve expedited our decision. <strong>We will be archiving our corporate outreach, undercover investigation, humane education, and online ads reports on September 14</strong>. This will allow interested readers to reference them easily for the next week&#x2014;though even when they are archived, the reports will remain available on our site via the search tool.</p>\n<p>We were glad to learn that Mr. Halstead agrees that our 2017 <a href=\"https://animalcharityevaluators.org/advocacy-interventions/interventions/leafleting/\">leafleting intervention report</a> was of good standard, and I&apos;d add that our 2017 <a href=\"https://animalcharityevaluators.org/advocacy-interventions/interventions/protests/\">protest intervention report</a> is of a similar standard. These are our two most recent intervention reports, and they both utilize the new intervention research methodology that we officially <a href=\"https://animalcharityevaluators.org/blog/ace-highlight-intervention-evaluation-guide/\">introduced</a> last November. Our new methodology includes a more systematic literature search, facilitates more transparent communication about our reasoning, and allows for more rigorous statistical analysis, when appropriate. We will ensure that all of our future intervention work is as rigorous as our leafleting and protest reports, if not more so.</p>\n<h2>The Role of Cost-Effectiveness Estimates in our Work</h2>\n<p>Mr. Halstead is correct that we have multiple platforms in which we present our views. He divides these platforms into three categories: (i) intervention reports, (ii) CEEs, and (iii) the &quot;all things considered&quot; views expressed in our charity reviews. In fact&#x2014;in our intervention reports as well as in our charity reviews&#x2014;we present (i) CEEs and (ii) &quot;all things considered&quot; views.</p>\n<p>Mr. Halstead is also correct that the views expressed on these different platforms sometimes differ. &quot;For example,&quot; he writes, &quot;the view expressed in the intervention report on investigations is different to the view expressed in the cost-effectiveness analyses of investigations.&quot; Actually, I&apos;d suggest that the views expressed in our intervention reports are <em>often</em> quite different from the views expressed in our charity reviews. Additionally&#x2014;in both our intervention reports and our charity reviews&#x2014;our cost-effectiveness estimates are <em>often</em> quite different from our overall (or &quot;all things considered&quot;) views. These differences are intentional and justified, as I&apos;ll explain below.</p>\n<h3>The Relationship Between the Cost-Effectiveness Estimates and the Overall Views Expressed in our Intervention Reports</h3>\n<p>Our overall views of an intervention are informed by a number of factors other than our best estimate of the average cost-effectiveness of that intervention. After all, practical decisions about whether or not to devote further resources to an intervention should be made based on the intervention&apos;s <em>marginal</em> cost-effectiveness, and our CEEs estimate the intervention&apos;s <em>average</em> cost-effectiveness.</p>\n<p>In order to develop a sense of an intervention&apos;s marginal cost-effectiveness, we consider how its average cost-effectiveness might change over time depending on the amount of resources invested in it, its interactions with other interventions, shifts in public opinion or political context, and so on. Even if we believe an intervention is currently highly cost-effective, we might think that investing further in it would have diminishing returns. Similarly, we consider whether an intervention might be <em>necessary</em> for the success of the animal advocacy movement. If so, we may recommend investing further in that intervention even if it doesn&apos;t currently seem to be accomplishing many tangible benefits. And of course, there are always costs and benefits of interventions that we simply don&apos;t include in our CEEs because they can&apos;t be quantified with any helpful degree of precision, though we discuss such costs and benefits elsewhere in our reports and they do factor into our overall views.</p>\n<p>Mr. Halstead repeatedly claims that our &quot;all things considered&quot; view is that most forms of grassroots advocacy have &quot;close to zero effect.&quot; That&apos;s not our view, and it&apos;s also not how we think about whether or not to recommend interventions. As quoted, we wrote in our THL review that &quot;there is little evidence available&quot; for the effects of the grassroots outreach that THL conducts, such as &quot;leafleting, online ads, and education.&quot; We also wrote that we &quot;do not currently recommend the use of leafleting or online ads as we suspect that they are not as effective as some other means of public outreach.&quot; It does not follow from these claims that our overall view is that grassroots advocacy has close to no effect. As we explain in the preceding paragraph of THL&apos;s review, &quot;we still think it&apos;s important for the animal movement to target some outreach toward individuals, as a shift in public attitudes could lead to greater support for new animal-friendly policies. Public outreach might even be a necessary precursor to achieving institutional change.&quot; In other words, because of the possible necessity of grassroots outreach and because of its interactions with other interventions, our overall view of grassroots outreach is distinct from our CEEs for leafleting, online ads, and humane education.</p>\n<h3>The Relationship Between the Cost-Effectiveness Estimates and Overall Views Expressed in our Charity Reviews</h3>\n<p>The CEEs included in our charity reviews are very rough estimates of a charity&apos;s average cost-effectiveness. We emphasize strongly (with <a href=\"https://animalcharityevaluators.org/charity-review/animal-equality/#c3\">bold letters</a>) that they should not be taken as our overall view of a charity&apos;s effectiveness. Our overall view of each charity is informed by all seven of our <a href=\"https://animalcharityevaluators.org/charity-reviews/evaluating-charities/evaluation-criteria/\">criteria</a>.</p>\n<p>Mr. Halstead seems to believe that our CEEs are the most important factor in our recommendation decisions. When we reminded him in conversation about our six other criteria, he argued that we wouldn&apos;t value factors like strong leadership or track record in a charity that wasn&apos;t cost-effective, and that therefore our CEEs must play a central role in our recommendation decisions. That seems like a fair assumption to make about an effective altruist organization. Once again, though, our CEEs are estimates of the average cost-effectiveness of the charity over the past year, and we make our recommendation decisions based on our beliefs about the marginal cost-effectiveness of each charity. We consider all seven of our criteria to be largely independent indications of marginal cost-effectiveness, as I&apos;ll explain below.</p>\n<p>Suppose we learn that the director of a charity we&apos;re evaluating has been embezzling money (though this has never happened). Even if we believe the charity has a high average cost-effectiveness in its work for animals, we might believe that donations to the charity have low marginal cost-effectiveness because the charity is about to lose its director to prison. Therefore, we consider strong leadership to be an indication of a charity&apos;s marginal cost-effectiveness <em>independently</em> of the charity&apos;s average cost-effectiveness. Similarly, suppose we review a charity&apos;s track record and find that it accomplishes more every year on the same budget. Even if its average cost-effectiveness is currently low, we might be optimistic about the marginal cost-effectiveness of donations to that charity. Therefore, we consider track record to be an indication of a charity&apos;s marginal cost-effectiveness <em>independently</em> of the charity&apos;s average cost-effectiveness.</p>\n<p>Mr. Halstead highlights some problems with our older intervention research and concludes that: &quot;consequently ACE&apos;s research does not provide much reason to believe that their recommended charities actually improve animal welfare.&quot; If he had said that our<em> cost-effectiveness estimates</em> (on their own) don&apos;t provide much reason to believe that our recommended charities actually improve animal welfare, I might have agreed with him. However, as we explain in our reviews, we put limited weight on those estimates. Our research provides <em>many</em> reasons to believe that our recommended charities help animals. Those reasons can be found in all seven sections of our reviews.</p>\n<h3>The Relationship Between our Intervention Research and our Charity Reviews</h3>\n<p>Mr. Halstead notes some apparent inconsistencies between our intervention research and our charity reviews. For example, he points out that: &quot;[ACE&apos;s] view as of August 2018 is that grassroots advocacy has close to no effect, though ACE does estimate that THL&apos;s online outreach is beneficial.&quot; As mentioned, we feel this is a misrepresentation of our overall view of grassroots outreach. However, the point I&apos;d like to make now is that there are sometimes good reasons why our overall view of an intervention might differ from our assessment of that intervention <em>as it is implemented by a particular charity</em>.</p>\n<p>Any given intervention can vary widely in its cost-effectiveness depending on how it is implemented. When we model the cost-effectiveness of an intervention, we have to make certain assumptions about how that intervention is implemented. For example, in our <a href=\"https://animalcharityevaluators.org/advocacy-interventions/interventions/protests/#4\">protest report</a>, we modeled the cost-effectiveness of the types of protests implemented by THL. If we were writing a charity review for a group like <a href=\"https://www.anonymousforthevoiceless.org/\">Anonymous for the Voiceless</a>, which uses a very different kind of protest, our model of the cost-effectiveness of their protests might look very different from the model in our protest report.</p>\n<p>Readers may be wondering: what is the value of our intervention reports if they aren&apos;t necessarily the basis for the CEEs in our charity reviews? Our answer is two-fold. First, our overall views of each intervention do play some role in our reviews, particularly in Criterion 2 (&quot;Does the charity engage in programs that seem likely to be highly impactful?&quot;). Second, our new methodology for our intervention research was designed to make our intervention reports useful in other ways. For instance, we examine factors that might make an intervention <em>more</em> or <em>less</em> cost-effective, which we hope will be of use to other charities.</p>\n<h3>Further Thoughts on the Role of Cost-Effectiveness Estimates in our Charity Reviews</h3>\n<p>A discussion of the role of our CEEs in our charity reviews may appear to be tangential to the points that Mr. Halstead has raised. Because Mr. Halstead believes that our CEEs both <em>should be</em> and <em>are</em> the most important factor in our recommendation decisions, he may not perceive there to be any problem with the role that our CEEs play in our reviews and therefore didn&apos;t discuss it in his post. However, the role of our CEEs in our reviews is actually a key point in this exchange. It is the implicit assumption that allows Mr. Halstead to infer from the flaws in our corporate outreach report that our charity evaluation research &quot;does not provide much reason to believe that their recommended charities actually improve animal welfare.&quot;</p>\n<p>Mr. Halstead&apos;s chain of reasoning seems to be:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>ACE&apos;s corporate outreach intervention report is flawed.</li>\n<li>Corporate outreach accounts for 90% of THL&apos;s and Animal Equality&apos;s CEEs.</li>\n<li>Each charity&apos;s CEE is the primary piece of evidence that the charity improves animal welfare.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Therefore,</p>\n<p>4. ACE does not provide much reason to believe that their recommended charities improve animal welfare.</p>\n<p>Even if we grant (1) and (2),<sup><a href=\"#2\">[2]</a></sup> we&apos;ve now explained that premise (3) is false, and therefore Mr. Halstead&apos;s conclusion does not follow.</p>\n<h2>Our Plans for ACE&apos;s Research Department</h2>\n<p>ACE&apos;s specific research plans for next year have not yet been set; we have annual strategic planning sessions in December or January, after our charity reviews are released. However, as ACE&apos;s new director of research, I can make the following public commitments about our future work:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>We will archive our outdated intervention reports on September 14, 2018.</li>\n<li>After our reviews are published in November (and we therefore have more time), we will consider whether we should add any of the problems raised by Mr. Halstead to our public <a href=\"https://animalcharityevaluators.org/transparency/mistakes/\">mistakes</a> page.</li>\n<li>Our future intervention reports will meet or exceed the standards set by our protest and leafleting reports.</li>\n<li>We will continue working to clearly describe the role that CEEs play in our charity reviews, since this has continually caused confusion among our community.</li>\n<li>In our 2018 reviews, we are no longer using our online ads report in our CEEs.</li>\n<li>We will make every effort to keep our readers apprised of our most current views on our research.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Updating our corporate outreach report is of particularly high priority for us, and Mr. Halstead is correct that this was also true in 2017. I spent the majority of my time this year working on an updated report, but my priorities shifted when I moved into my new position. When our charity reviews are complete, I will either finish up the report or pass it on to another team member.</p>\n<p>We are considering further updating our intervention research methodology by breaking our reports into smaller pieces that can be published individually. That way, we would be able to publish or update some pieces of the reports more quickly than we are currently able to publish or update full reports.</p>\n<p>As Mr. Halstead points out, we have not yet conducted much original research on the impact of various welfare reforms. We&apos;ve generally left this work to other groups. However, we are considering doing more welfare research in the future. In fact, we have a report on fish welfare that is currently being copy edited for publication. One of our goals is to better anticipate which welfare reforms charities will pursue each year so that we can research the effects of those reforms independently and before we evaluate the charities, rather than by relying on others&apos; work while we evaluate charities. We think this will both improve our charity evaluations and allow us to be more useful to charities that are considering which reforms to pursue.</p>\n<h2>Comments on Some Miscellaneous Claims</h2>\n<blockquote>&quot;Corporate outreach accounts for the majority of the modelled impact of both charities in the cost-effectiveness analyses of <a href=\"https://www.getguesstimate.com/models/9604?token=CkrbzlMlrvv6XJOuZ3wmLJwtvnkJoD2aIY79V6DuAe3Wk5t0WP-q4O5Eu9eDuL-jzqz5w1I_YARjtTakfkWesA\">THL</a> and <a href=\"https://www.getguesstimate.com/models/9590?token=sSMogCCGAhX_PxpHvvOxEp_lP376AAmzJ3YL2XKYMqebUal1E8zL86vNw7-ZQRcPFKDkKAaATiN3g9CDuj5XVA\">Animal Equality</a>: for THL, ~90% of the modelled impact is from corporate outreach, and ~10% from online outreach; and for Animal Equality, &gt;90% of the modelled impact is from corporate outreach.&quot;</blockquote>\n<p>Our team is unsure how Mr. Halstead arrived at these percentages, though we shared with him in conversation that we believe they are incorrect. We assume that when Mr. Halstead refers to the portion of the &quot;modeled impact&quot; of corporate outreach, he means the portion of the charity&apos;s modeled impact that is due to corporate outreach weighted by the portion of the charity&apos;s budget that supports corporate outreach. By our calculations, corporate outreach accounts for about 63% of THL&apos;s 2017 CEE and about 36% of Animal Equality&apos;s 2017 CEE.<sup><a href=\"#3\">[3]</a></sup></p>\n<blockquote>&quot;When I asked ACE about this in 2017, they said that the basis for the figure was another page on the impacts of media coverage on meat demand, which is not linked to or referenced at that point on the cost-effectiveness analysis of undercover investigations.&quot;</blockquote>\n<p>We should have made this reference much clearer, though for what it&apos;s worth, the page on the impacts of media coverage on meat demand is linked in <a href=\"https://animalcharityevaluators.org/advocacy-interventions/interventions/undercover-investigations/#V3\">Section V.3</a> and the figure Mr. Halstead is referencing appears in Section V.3.1.</p>\n<blockquote>&quot;ACE does not have up to date research of sufficient quality on the welfare effects of corporate campaigns.&quot;</blockquote>\n<p>It&apos;s true that we have not conducted much original research on the impact of various corporate campaigns on animal welfare. However, we do not just rely on our own research when we estimate the impact of these campaigns. We also rely on relevant research produced by other groups (e.g., The Open Philanthropy Project&apos;s <a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/new-report-welfare-differences-between-cage-and-cage-free-housing\">report</a> on the welfare differences between cage and cage-free housing).</p>\n<blockquote>&quot;ACE also does not check whether their recommended charities are genuinely causally responsible for the corporate policy successes that they claim,&quot; and &quot;ACE does not check with third party news sources, experts or with the companies themselves on whether the claims of the charities are accurate.&quot;</blockquote>\n<p>We do search online for evidence in the news of each charity&apos;s achievements. The problem is: there usually is no such evidence, particularly in the field of corporate outreach. Of course, the absence of evidence of a charity&apos;s involvement in a corporate campaign is not evidence that the charity was not involved. We&apos;ve also looked up corporations&apos; press releases announcing their commitments, but these generally do not mention animal charities. (As far as I can remember, I&apos;ve never seen one that does.) We have little reason to believe that a corporation could or would share detailed information about their decisions with us if we asked them. I don&apos;t know who Mr. Halstead has in mind when he mentions checking with &quot;experts,&quot; though we&apos;ve certainly spoken with many experts in corporate campaigning, if that is what he means.</p>\n<p>We are always looking for ways to better assess charities&apos; claims. In the meantime, when we can&apos;t corroborate a charity&apos;s claims with a third party, we are careful to state in our reviews that the charity &quot;reports&quot; or &quot;claims&quot; to have achieved X or Y, rather than that they have done so.</p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Edited 9/11/18</strong>: Please see <a href=\"/**Edited 9/11/18:** Please see [this comment exchange](http:/effective-altruism.com/ea/1sq/response_to_john_halstead/fhb) between Avi Norowitz and me for some additional details regarding our evaluation of the extent to which charities cause some corporate policy commitment.

Corporate outreach accounted for an estimated 49% of THL&apos;s budget in 2017, which equates to 63% of the programs we modeled, and thus 63% of the total CEE.

I show that some of ACE&#x2019;s older research is of low quality, and should be removed from the website - ACE&#x2019;s new Research Director agrees with this. More importantly, ACE&#x2019;s research on the impact of corporate campaigns is flawed, and consequently ACE&#x2019;s research does not provide much reason to believe that their recommended charities actually improve animal welfare. This is not a criticism of ACE&#x2019;s recommended charities. I conclude with some thoughts about how ACE could improve and note a cause for optimism, as a new Research Director arrives.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p>ACE&#x2019;s research has been criticised in the past, most notably in a December 2016 <a href=\"https://medium.com/@harrisonnathan/the-actual-number-is-almost-surely-higher-92c908f36517\">blogpost</a> by Harrison Nathan. ACE&#x2019;s research has improved since then with some of the most serious problems being resolved. For example, their <a href=\"https://animalcharityevaluators.org/advocacy-interventions/interventions/leafleting/\">November 2017 leafleting report</a> was of a good standard, and was a major improvement on their previous leafleting report, which was of poor quality. However, I have examined ACE&#x2019;s research in 2018 and 2017 and believe that it still contains some serious flaws.</p>\n<p>Evaluating the impact of animal charities is generally more difficult than evaluating the impact of charities carrying out direct health interventions because evidence is sparse and much hinges on difficult questions about animal sentience. Consequently, ACE&#x2019;s research team faces a harder problem than GiveWell&#x2019;s. However, this point notwithstanding, ACE&#x2019;s research still falls short of what we should expect. The problems concern the failure to remove low quality older research and, more importantly, the reasoning for judgements about the effectiveness of corporate campaigns.</p>\n<p><!-- [if !supportLists]--><span><span>1.<span>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; </span></span></span><!--[endif]-->Old research</p>\n<p><!-- [if !supportLists]--><span><span>a.<span>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; </span></span></span><!--[endif]-->Many of ACE&#x2019;s older intervention reports are of low quality, and should have been removed from ACE&#x2019;s website.</p>\n<p><!-- [if !supportLists]--><span><span>b.<span>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; </span></span></span><!--[endif]-->ACE now acknowledges in private that these reports are of low quality and for the most part does not rely on them in its charity reviews, but in many cases ACE fails to inform reader of this fact.</p>\n<p><!-- [if !supportLists]--><span><span>2.<span>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; </span></span></span><!--[endif]-->Corporate campaigns</p>\n<p><!-- [if !supportLists]--><span><span>a.<span>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; </span></span></span><!--[endif]-->ACE does not have up to date research of sufficient quality on the welfare effects of corporate campaigns.</p>\n<p><!-- [if !supportLists]--><span><span>b.<span>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; </span></span></span><!--[endif]-->ACE also does not check whether their recommended charities are genuinely causally responsible for the corporate policy successes that they claim. &#xA0;</p>\n<p>The problems I discuss here pertain only to the reviews of The Humane League (THL) and Animal Equality, as I have not had time to look into their research on the Good Food Institute. <strong><em>This piece is in no way a critique of ACE&#x2019;s recommended charities.</em> </strong></p>\n<p>I publish this critique firstly in the hope that it will encourage an improvement in standards at ACE; secondly, that it will encourage external scrutiny of ACE research going forward; and finally that it will provide information relevant to individual donors. In August 2018, ACE appointed a new Research Director, Toni Adleberg, who should not be held responsible for the mistakes discussed here. My interactions with Ms Adleberg and other members of ACE&#x2019;s current research staff have been very positive, and I am optimistic that there will be improvements in ACE&#x2019;s research in the future.</p>\n<p><em>Disclosure</em>: I interned at ACE for a few months in 2015. I am currently an unpaid external research consultant for ACE, and have thus far carried out about 2 hours of work for them in this role. ACE reviewed this piece prior to publication. The views expressed here are my own, not those of Founders Pledge.</p>\n<h3>1. ACE&#x2019;s view on the impact of their recommended charities</h3>\n<p>Before we begin, it is useful to distinguish three platforms in which ACE presents its views:</p>\n<p><!-- [if !supportLists]--><span><span>1.<span>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; </span></span></span><!--[endif]-->Intervention reports</p>\n<p><!-- [if !supportLists]--><span><span>2.<span>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; </span></span></span><!--[endif]-->Cost-effectiveness analyses</p>\n<p><!-- [if !supportLists]--><span><span>3.<span>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; </span></span></span><!--[endif]-->Current all-things-considered view expressed in charity reviews</p>\n<p>The view expressed in each these three things are often different. For example, the view expressed in the intervention report on investigations is different to the view expressed in the cost-effectiveness analyses of investigations. ACE is also at pains to point out that their cost-effectiveness analyses are only supposed to give a very rough picture of the cost-effectiveness of their charities, and they say that cost-effectiveness analyses play &#x201C;only a limited role in our overall opinions of which charities and interventions are most effective&#x201D;.<a title=\"\" href=\"file:///C:/Users/Admin/Google%20Drive/Founders%20Pledge/ACE%20reports/ACE%20word%20version.docx#_ftn1\"><span><span><span><!-- [if !supportFootnotes]--><span><span>[1]</span></span></span></span></span></a></p>\n<p>With this clarified, we can now outline ACE&#x2019;s current view on THL and Animal Equality have impact. The interventions pursued by these two organisations can be divided into <em>grassroots outreach</em> and <em>corporate outreach</em>. As I am defining the term, grassroots outreach includes things like leafleting, online ads, social media outreach, humane education, and undercover investigations.</p>\n<p>Corporate outreach accounts for the majority of the modelled impact of both charities <em>in the cost-effectiveness analyses</em> of <a href=\"https://www.getguesstimate.com/models/9604?token=CkrbzlMlrvv6XJOuZ3wmLJwtvnkJoD2aIY79V6DuAe3Wk5t0WP-q4O5Eu9eDuL-jzqz5w1I_YARjtTakfkWesA\">THL</a> and <a href=\"https://www.getguesstimate.com/models/9590?token=sSMogCCGAhX_PxpHvvOxEp_lP376AAmzJ3YL2XKYMqebUal1E8zL86vNw7-ZQRcPFKDkKAaATiN3g9CDuj5XVA\">Animal Equality</a>: for THL, ~90% of the modelled impact is from corporate outreach, and ~10% from online outreach; and for Animal Equality, &gt;90% of the modelled impact is from corporate outreach. This seems consistent with ACE&#x2019;s all-things-considered view of which interventions are likely to be impactful. ACE says that &#x201C;[corporate campaigns] can be highly impactful when implemented thoughtfully&#x201D;.<a title=\"\" href=\"file:///C:/Users/Admin/Google%20Drive/Founders%20Pledge/ACE%20reports/ACE%20word%20version.docx#_ftn2\"><span><span><span><!-- [if !supportFootnotes]--><span><span>[2]</span></span><!--[endif]--></span></span></span></a> ACE seems to be pessimistic about grassroots outreach, saying:</p>\n<p><span>&#x201C;THL works to effect change through several different kinds of outreach, including leafleting, online ads, and education. While there is little evidence available about the effectiveness of these interventions, we do not currently recommend the use of leafleting or online ads as we suspect that they are not as effective as some other means of public outreach.&#x201D;</span><a title=\"\" href=\"file:///C:/Users/Admin/Google%20Drive/Founders%20Pledge/ACE%20reports/ACE%20word%20version.docx#_ftn3\"><span><span><span><!-- [if !supportFootnotes]--><span><span>[3]</span></span></span></span></span></a></p>\n<p>Thus, ACE&#x2019;s view as of August 2018 is that grassroots advocacy has close to no effect, though ACE does estimate that THL&#x2019;s online outreach is beneficial. I discuss this in section 2b.</p>\n<h3>2. Grassroots outreach</h3>\n<p>In this section, I discuss ACE&#x2019;s research on the impact of grassroots outreach. Due to lack of data on the impact of most forms of grassroots outreach, in their cost-effectiveness analyses, ACE estimates the impact of most forms of grassroots outreach &#x2013; humane education, investigations and Animal Equality&#x2019;s i360 video outreach &#x2013; &#xA0;by assuming that they were X times as effective as leafleting. For example, we would, the argument goes, intuitively expect humane education to be ~5 times as cost-effective as leafleting, and leafleting spares X animals from factory farming, so humane education spares ~5x animals from factory farming.<span>&#xA0; </span></p>\n<p>Prior to November 2017, ACE believed that leafleting produced fairly substantial benefits. However, in November 2017, ACE published a <a href=\"https://animalcharityevaluators.org/advocacy-interventions/interventions/leafleting/\">new leafleting report</a>, stating that their view on the impact of leafleting had changed. They now believe that leafleting has tiny impact, and is in fact very slightly harmful. However, ACE continues to infer the impact of other forms of grassroots outreach from the impact of leafleting, using a scaling factor. Thus, because they judge humane education to be ~5 times as effective as leafleting and they estimate leafleting to be harmful, they now estimate that the mean effect of humane education is 5x as harmful as leafleting. It is not clear that continuing to use a scaling factor makes sense when the sign of the effect has changed, but that is perhaps open to debate. They continue to use this approach for modelling the impact of humane education, investigations, and Animal Equality&#x2019;s video outreach.</p>\n<p>Setting the specifics of the cost-effectiveness analysis to one side, as mentioned, ACE&#x2019;s apparent current all-things-considered view is that all forms of grassroots outreach (with the possible exception of online ads) have close to zero effect. I agree that grassroots outreach is likely to have very small effects because securing dietary change through advocacy appears to be very difficult, with the best data suggesting that the percentage of veg*ns has barely increased since the 1990s, as discussed in <a href=\"https://animalcharityevaluators.org/blog/is-the-percentage-of-vegetarians-and-vegans-in-the-u-s-increasing/#summary\">this</a> excellent recent ACE blog. &#xA0;</p>\n<h5>2a. Investigations</h5>\n<p>Of THL and Animal Equality, only Animal Equality carries out investigations. The Feb 2016 <a href=\"https://animalcharityevaluators.org/advocacy-interventions/interventions/undercover-investigations/\">intervention report on investigations</a> on ACE&#x2019;s website evaluates the impact of investigations in a different way to the cost-effectiveness analyses of Animal Equality, and produces a different estimate of their impact. The quality of the intervention report is low. One major concern is that the impact calculations are done in a table, rather than in a spreadsheet or <a href=\"https://www.getguesstimate.com/\">Guesstimate</a> model, making it difficult to understand important inputs, calculations and outputs.</p>\n<h6>Direct suffering avoided per intervention unit</h6>\n<p>An &#x2018;intervention unit&#x2019; is the measure of the length of an intervention. For investigations, 1 intervention unit is 1 investigation. A unit of suffering is a year of farmed captivity, or equivalent, averted.</p>\n<p>ACE provides pessimistic and realistic (but not optimistic) estimates of &#x2018;direct suffering per intervention unit&#x2019;. No explanation is given for these figures and they are actually the same as the &#x2018;indirect suffering avoided per intervention unit&#x2019;. Assuming that direct and indirect suffering averted are intended to be different, this suggests a mistake that should have been noticed in a review of the page. Here is a screenshot (I have added the column labels from a separate screenshot); these numbers appear without any explanatory calculations.<span><!--[endif]--></span></p>\n<p><span><span><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/vkWQZVwsKykeulkiBAFHZvuacfqBSpvyKfbdiQlzB_fvJX0e3J42nFIkNlajPwH5ylMinFKMlTz_sqK9yV1Hg-xISVw9H5SSIsGsKDV8utyLs9qrdu_UVpHDIYYwmxzsXVZ9PpKw\"></span></span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span><span><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/T4UMQ0Lc9JyKkxFPpA6zzUnSgqZp6VztaaiXgO_nYW7CCCDN8dKXIbUjY2BNv9mTRHvA1I0g4Nhtb81CiPoHX8qz6gUUtW02-CKaTiC4ffGIKxuG7Dzd83LFcTYoKzKrvhuRXUyv\"></span></span></p>\n<p>(Screenshot: 15th August 2018, about 95% of the way down the page)</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<h6>Indirect suffering avoided per intervention unit</h6>\n<p>This is a screenshot of the relevant part of the table on &#x2018;indirect suffering avoided per intervention unit&#x2019; (again, I have added the column labels from a different screenshot further up the page):<span><!--[endif]--></span></p>\n<p><span><span><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/vkWQZVwsKykeulkiBAFHZvuacfqBSpvyKfbdiQlzB_fvJX0e3J42nFIkNlajPwH5ylMinFKMlTz_sqK9yV1Hg-xISVw9H5SSIsGsKDV8utyLs9qrdu_UVpHDIYYwmxzsXVZ9PpKw\"></span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/vzQjY--KMtwQhFOu31rq4hHjsrbemQP_BvQFE7kX6JSkzEWzdDJdXUVOhvDLldSmtkBwle6L0_kedzKLy0zb7Nw8avOmCKzch_k9eeJfqKUedn0fvd4C_iI6ONQYjD1wrMISWP0-\"></span></span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p>(Screenshot: 15th August 2018, about 95% of the way down the page)</p>\n<p>There are three problems with this. Firstly, ACE estimates the reach of a campaign stating:</p>\n<p><span>&#x2018;A person does not have to be directly contacted by a staff member in order to be &#x201C;reached&#x201D;. They must merely encounter the campaign in some capacity, including living under a legal jurisdiction being targeted by a legislative campaign.&#x2019;</span></p>\n<p>The condition specified in the second sentence is clearly inappropriate: obviously, not everyone who lives in a legal jurisdiction targeted by a campaign should count as being reached by the campaign.</p>\n<p>Secondly, the optimistic estimate cannot be correct and is therefore not a reasonable rendering of &#x2018;optimistic&#x2019;. It implies that each undercover investigation makes 2.8% of those reached vegetarian or vegan. If, as estimated in the Feb 2016 intervention report, each campaign will reach ~9m people, this would imply that each campaign will create&#xA0;~250,000 new vegetarians or vegans. Since Animal Equality runs 20 investigations a year,<a title=\"\" href=\"file:///C:/Users/Admin/Google%20Drive/Founders%20Pledge/ACE%20reports/ACE%20word%20version.docx#_ftn4\"><span><span><span><!-- [if !supportFootnotes]--><span><span>[4]</span></span><!--[endif]--></span></span></span></a> this would imply that they alone will create ~5m new vegetarians or vegans per year exclusively through their undercover investigations. It is somewhat difficult to estimate how many vegetarians there are in the US because accurately tracking dietary habits is challenging and people tend to lie about their animal product consumption. While up to 6% of people in the US self-identify as vegetarian or vegan, but studies that ask people whether they ate meat or fish on two consecutive 24 hour periods show that the vegetarianism rate remains below 1.5%. See <a href=\"https://animalcharityevaluators.org/blog/is-the-percentage-of-vegetarians-and-vegans-in-the-u-s-increasing/#summary\">this</a> ACE blog for more. Even on the higher estimate based on self-identification, the estimate of the impact of investigations cannot be correct.</p>\n<p>Thirdly, no explanation is provided for the pessimistic or realistic estimates; as you can see in the above screenshot, headline figures appear without any calculations. This is concerning. When I asked ACE about this in 2017, they said that the basis for the figure was another page on the impacts of media coverage on meat demand, which is not referenced at that point on the cost-effectiveness analysis of undercover investigations.<a title=\"\" href=\"file:///C:/Users/Admin/Google%20Drive/Founders%20Pledge/ACE%20reports/ACE%20word%20version.docx#_ftn5\"><span><span><span><!-- [if !supportFootnotes]--><span><span>[5]</span></span></span></span></span></a></p>\n<p>I pointed all of this out to ACE in September 2017, and they acknowledged that this was a mistake, but the page has still not been altered as of August 2018. I think this page should be immediately removed. In conversation with ACE&#x2019;s new research team, they have told me that they were already considering removing these old intervention reports before I sent them this report, which is an encouraging sign.<a title=\"\" href=\"file:///C:/Users/Admin/Google%20Drive/Founders%20Pledge/ACE%20reports/ACE%20word%20version.docx#_ftn6\"><span><span><span><!-- [if !supportFootnotes]--><span><span>[6]</span></span></span></span></span></a></p>\n<h5>2b. Online ads</h5>\n<p>As I mentioned above, in ACE&#x2019;s cost-effectiveness analysis, online ads are responsible for around 10% of THL&#x2019;s impact. &#xA0;There are two main problems with ACE&#x2019;s treatment of online ads.</p>\n<p>Firstly, it models the effect of online ads in a different way to how it models other similar forms of grassroots outreach. As discussed above, ACE uses the &#x2018;leafleting scaling factor&#x2019; approach for all other forms of grassroots outreach. It does not use this approach for online ads, despite the fact that it seems that whatever rationale justifies using the &#x2018;leafleting scaling factor&#x2019; approach for other forms of grassroots outreach must also apply to online ads. For example, Animal Equality&#x2019;s <a href=\"https://ianimal360.com/\">i360 video outreach</a> seems functionally similar to online ads, and yet a different approach is taken for each.</p>\n<p>Secondly, in its cost-effectiveness analysis of THL&#x2019;s online ads, ACE relies on an August 2016 <a href=\"https://animalcharityevaluators.org/advocacy-interventions/interventions/online-ads/#full-review\">intervention report on online ads</a>. This report is highly opaque and it is very unclear how ACE arrived at certain crucial figures, such as number of vegetarians created per click on an online ad. Here is the crucial section in the cost-effectiveness estimate of online ads:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/tI6h2f4z0GZzoMJvn6NLG_zSvY0E7-q7p46dwS0veeEqeh7-brfg-wQOTx9lZpTFTRBIb35nkd0KpLyGQpfyu6YltYuudoqFku3QFM8OomkqcDooGOxOifgtAm2eaiGJr23GjTP5\">&#xA0;</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>&#xA0;</span>Source: <a href=\"https://animalcharityevaluators.org/advocacy-interventions/interventions/online-ads/#full-review\">intervention report, online ads</a> (as of 10<sup>th</sup> August 2018)</p>\n<p>The reasoning presented for these numbers is limited, and because the numbers are presented in a table rather than a spreadsheet, it is not clear how they are combined together.</p>\n<p>When I asked about this in October 2017, ACE said the researcher who made the calculation has left and that the factors bearing on it were not weighted in a formal way that could be publicly explained.<a title=\"\" href=\"file:///C:/Users/Admin/Google%20Drive/Founders%20Pledge/ACE%20reports/ACE%20word%20version.docx#_ftn7\"><span><span><span><!-- [if !supportFootnotes]--><span><span>[7]</span></span><!--[endif]--></span></span></span></a> Indeed, in the comprehensive review of Animal Equality, ACE says &#x201C;There is little evidence, thus far, about the effectiveness of online outreach...&#x201D;<a title=\"\" href=\"file:///C:/Users/Admin/Google%20Drive/Founders%20Pledge/ACE%20reports/ACE%20word%20version.docx#_ftn8\"><span><span><span><!-- [if !supportFootnotes]--><span><span>[8]</span></span></span></span></span></a></p>\n<p>In summary, ACE has used figures which it cannot publicly explain and which it now rejects, to estimate the impact of one of its recommended charities</p>\n<h3>3. Corporate campaigns</h3>\n<p>In their cost-effectiveness analyses, ACE estimates that corporate campaigns account for the vast majority of the impact of their recommended charities. It also appears to be ACE&#x2019;s all-things-considered view in its charity reviews that corporate campaigns are one of the highest impact interventions. For example, in its review of THL, ACE says of interventions aiming to influence industry &#x201C;We find that these interventions can be highly impactful when implemented thoughtfully&#x201D;.<a title=\"\" href=\"file:///C:/Users/Admin/Google%20Drive/Founders%20Pledge/ACE%20reports/ACE%20word%20version.docx#_ftn9\"><span><span><span><!-- [if !supportFootnotes]--><span><span>[9]</span></span></span></span></span></a></p>\n<p>However, ACE&#x2019;s research on corporate campaigns is flawed in four ways. These flaws are the most important ones I have found, given how important corporate campaigns are in ACE&#x2019;s current research.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>In the November 2014 intervention report on corporate campaigns, ACE did not carry out a comprehensive literature review of the evidence on the welfare effects of cage-free systems. They relied only on a paper by De Mol et al (2006), which seems quite badly flawed, as discussed in a <a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/new-report-welfare-differences-between-cage-and-cage-free-housing\">report</a> by the Open Philanthropy Project published in September 2017 (<a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/focus/us-policy/farm-animal-welfare/how-will-hen-welfare-be-impacted-transition-cage-free-housing#Appendix:_Examination_of_DeMol_et_al_2006\">specific section of the report on De Mol et al (2006)</a>).<a title=\"\" href=\"file:///C:/Users/Admin/Google%20Drive/Founders%20Pledge/ACE%20reports/ACE%20word%20version.docx#_ftn10\"><span><span><span><!-- [if !supportFootnotes]--><span><span>[10]</span></span><!--[endif]--></span></span></span></a> The evidence on the welfare benefits of cage-free systems is much more unclear than suggested in ACE&#x2019;s assessment of corporate campaigns.</li>\n<li>ACE no longer endorses the conclusions in its intervention report on corporate campaigns, but does not inform the reader of this on the intervention report page or anywhere in the reviews of its recommended charities. The intervention report on corporate campaigns apparently plays no role in the cost-effectiveness estimate of corporate campaigns or in the charity reviews, but this is not explained to the reader. This leaves a major justificatory gap in ACE&#x2019;s research. In its cost-effectiveness analyses, ACE estimates that their mean estimate of the &#x201C;proportional improvement in welfare due to cage-free policies&#x201D; is ~0.05,<a title=\"\" href=\"file:///C:/Users/Admin/Google%20Drive/Founders%20Pledge/ACE%20reports/ACE%20word%20version.docx#_ftn11\"><span><span><span><!-- [if !supportFootnotes]--><span><span>[11]</span></span><!--[endif]--></span></span></span></a> but provides only a one sentence explanation for this estimate. This crucial figure should be defended with multiple page report and review of the science on the welfare effects of cages.</li>\n<li>ACE have been aware of the problems with the De Mol et al (2006) paper at least since September 2017, and told me in October 2017 that revising the corporate campaigns intervention report was a high priority for the coming year.<a title=\"\" href=\"file:///C:/Users/Admin/Google%20Drive/Founders%20Pledge/ACE%20reports/ACE%20word%20version.docx#_ftn12\"><span><span><span><!-- [if !supportFootnotes]--><span><span>[12]</span></span><!--[endif]--></span></span></span></a> As of August 2018, this report has still not been updated and ACE have told me that it will very likely be updated in early 2019.<a title=\"\" href=\"file:///C:/Users/Admin/Google%20Drive/Founders%20Pledge/ACE%20reports/ACE%20word%20version.docx#_ftn13\"><span><span><span><!-- [if !supportFootnotes]--><span><span>[13]</span></span><!--[endif]--></span></span></span></a> The report has now not been updated for almost four years. This progress seems much too slow given how important corporate campaigns are in ACE&#x2019;s evaluations, and according to conventional wisdom in effective animal advocacy.</li>\n<li>In its review of THL&#x2019;s and Animal Equality&#x2019;s corporate outreach, ACE relies only on the <em>charities&#x2019; self-reported corporate policy successes</em>, which it then discounts by an arbitrary uncertainty factor: ~0.4 for both Animal Equality and THL. ACE does not check with third party news sources, experts or with the companies themselves on whether the claims of the charities are accurate.<a title=\"\" href=\"file:///C:/Users/Admin/Google%20Drive/Founders%20Pledge/ACE%20reports/ACE%20word%20version.docx#_ftn14\"><span><span><span><!-- [if !supportFootnotes]--><span><span>[14]</span></span><!--[endif]--></span></span></span></a> This seems to me like basic due diligence that one should carry out when assessing corporate advocacy.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\n<p>ACE&#x2019;s research has improved somewhat over the last year or so, but serious problems remain. I believe that at present, donors interested in animal welfare would learn little from ACE&#x2019;s research. Some of the problems (those regarding grassroots outreach) chiefly concern the failure to remove older poor quality research and to adequately communicate their views to consumers of their research. Other problems (those regarding corporate outreach) are highly relevant to crucial judgements about whether ACE&#x2019;s recommended charities have any impact at all, or are even harmful (which is possible on some apparently reasonable views on the effects of cage-free systems).</p>\n<p><!-- [if !supportLists]--><span><span>1.<span>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; </span></span></span><!--[endif]-->Grassroots outreach</p>\n<p><!-- [if !supportLists]--><span><span>a.<span>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; </span></span></span><!--[endif]-->ACE believes that grassroots outreach has small to zero impact, which seems right.</p>\n<p><!-- [if !supportLists]--><span><span>b.<span>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; </span></span></span><!--[endif]-->However, ACE&#x2019;s intervention reports on many forms of grassroots outreach are of poor quality and should have been removed from ACE&#x2019;s website.</p>\n<p><!-- [if !supportLists]--><span><span>c.<span>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; </span></span></span><!--[endif]-->ACE does not communicate their current view of the quality of some of these reports, nor does it explain that the conclusions therein diverge from their current view.</p>\n<p><!-- [if !supportLists]--><span><span>2.<span>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; </span></span></span><!--[endif]-->Corporate outreach</p>\n<p><!-- [if !supportLists]--><span><span>a.<span>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; </span></span></span><!--[endif]-->Corporate outreach accounts for most of the recommended charities&#x2019; impact in ACE cost-effectiveness analyses and in their all-things-considered view of the impact of their charities.</p>\n<p><!-- [if !supportLists]--><span><span>b.<span>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; </span></span></span><!--[endif]-->In spite of that, ACE still does not have a high quality up to date review of corporate outreach or of the welfare effects cage-free systems.</p>\n<p><!-- [if !supportLists]--><span><span>c.<span>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; </span></span></span><!--[endif]-->ACE does not independently check the claims of charities about their corporate policy successes.</p>\n<p>To be clear, I do not think that these problems can be explained by the fact that cost-effectiveness analyses for animal interventions are extremely uncertain and should not be taken overly literally. The main problems pertain to research questions absolutely crucial to figuring out whether animal charities are beneficial or harmful, which have not been adequately answered by ACE.</p>\n<p>As I mentioned at the start of this brief, ACE research has improved over the last two years, and I am optimistic that with the arrival of their new Research Director, Toni Adleberg, ACE&#x2019;s research will improve at a faster pace in the future.

Quantifying the impact of animal charities is very difficult, but without quantifying impact, comparisons between charities become much more difficult. <span>&#xA0;</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<div><!-- [if !supportFootnotes]--><br><hr><!--[endif]-->\n<div>\n<p><a title=\"\" href=\"file:///C:/Users/Admin/Google%20Drive/Founders%20Pledge/ACE%20reports/ACE%20word%20version.docx#_ftnref1\"><span><span><span><!-- [if !supportFootnotes]--><span><span>[1]</span></span><!--[endif]--></span></span></span></a><span> See criterion 3 of the review of THL here - <a href=\"https://animalcharityevaluators.org/charity-review/the-humane-league/#c3\">https://animalcharityevaluators.org/charity-review/the-humane-league/#c3</a></span></p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p><a title=\"\" href=\"file:///C:/Users/Admin/Google%20Drive/Founders%20Pledge/ACE%20reports/ACE%20word%20version.docx#_ftnref2\"><span><span><span><!-- [if !supportFootnotes]--><span><span>[2]</span></span><!--[endif]--></span></span></span></a><span> See the &#x2018;influencing industry&#x2019; section under Criterion 2 here - <a href=\"https://animalcharityevaluators.org/charity-review/the-humane-league/#c2\">https://animalcharityevaluators.org/charity-review/the-humane-league/#c2</a></span></p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p><a title=\"\" href=\"file:///C:/Users/Admin/Google%20Drive/Founders%20Pledge/ACE%20reports/ACE%20word%20version.docx#_ftnref3\"><span><span><span><!-- [if !supportFootnotes]--><span><span>[3]</span></span><!--[endif]--></span></span></span></a><span> See the &#x2018;influencing public opinion&#x2019; section under Criterion 2 here - <a href=\"https://animalcharityevaluators.org/charity-review/the-humane-league/#c2\">https://animalcharityevaluators.org/charity-review/the-humane-league/#c2</a></span></p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p><a title=\"\" href=\"file:///C:/Users/Admin/Google%20Drive/Founders%20Pledge/ACE%20reports/ACE%20word%20version.docx#_ftnref4\"><span><span><span><!-- [if !supportFootnotes]--><span><span>[4]</span></span><!--[endif]--></span></span></span></a><span> See ACE&#x2019;s Animal Equality <a href=\"https://www.getguesstimate.com/models/9590?token=sSMogCCGAhX_PxpHvvOxEp_lP376AAmzJ3YL2XKYMqebUal1E8zL86vNw7-ZQRcPFKDkKAaATiN3g9CDuj5XVA\">cost-effectiveness analysis</a>.</span></p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p><a title=\"\" href=\"file:///C:/Users/Admin/Google%20Drive/Founders%20Pledge/ACE%20reports/ACE%20word%20version.docx#_ftnref5\"><span><span><span><!-- [if !supportFootnotes]--><span><span>[5]</span></span><!--[endif]--></span></span></span></a><span> Conversation with Allison Smith, former Research Director at ACE, 12<sup>th</sup> October 2017.</span></p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p><a title=\"\" href=\"file:///C:/Users/Admin/Google%20Drive/Founders%20Pledge/ACE%20reports/ACE%20word%20version.docx#_ftnref6\"><span><span><span><!-- [if !supportFootnotes]--><span><span>[6]</span></span><!--[endif]--></span></span></span></a><span> Conversation with Toni Adleberg and Jamie Spurgeon, 28th August 2018.</span></p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p><a title=\"\" href=\"file:///C:/Users/Admin/Google%20Drive/Founders%20Pledge/ACE%20reports/ACE%20word%20version.docx#_ftnref7\"><span><span><span><!-- [if !supportFootnotes]--><span><span>[7]</span></span><!--[endif]--></span></span></span></a><span> Conversation with Allison Smith of ACE, 12<sup>th</sup> October 2017.</span></p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p><a title=\"\" href=\"file:///C:/Users/Admin/Google%20Drive/Founders%20Pledge/ACE%20reports/ACE%20word%20version.docx#_ftnref8\"><span><span><span><!-- [if !supportFootnotes]--><span><span>[8]</span></span><!--[endif]--></span></span></span></a><span> <a href=\"https://animalcharityevaluators.org/charity-review/animal-equality/#c1\">https://animalcharityevaluators.org/charity-review/animal-equality/#c1</a></span></p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p><a title=\"\" href=\"file:///C:/Users/Admin/Google%20Drive/Founders%20Pledge/ACE%20reports/ACE%20word%20version.docx#_ftnref9\"><span><span><span><!-- [if !supportFootnotes]--><span><span>[9]</span></span><!--[endif]--></span></span></span></a><span> See the &#x2018;influencing industry&#x2019; section under Criterion 2 here - <a href=\"https://animalcharityevaluators.org/charity-review/the-humane-league/#c2\">https://animalcharityevaluators.org/charity-review/the-humane-league/#c2</a></span></p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p><a title=\"\" href=\"file:///C:/Users/Admin/Google%20Drive/Founders%20Pledge/ACE%20reports/ACE%20word%20version.docx#_ftnref10\"><span><span><span><!-- [if !supportFootnotes]--><span><span>[10]</span></span><!--[endif]--></span></span></span></a><span> Rudi M.

As a prominent moderate revolutionary, he was hiding from the angry mob organized under the motto of <em>liberty, equality and fraternity</em>. </p><p>It had been months since Robespierre labeled Condorcet a traitor and an enemy of the revolution. The marquis was guilty of raising his voice against the new Jacobin constitution \u2013 in his 1793 speech, he had pointed out that it had little in terms of checks and balances on central power. After losing this battle, he left into hiding for several months<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/newPost#_ftn1\">[1]</a>.</p><p>Condorcet was soon to join the venerable tradition of martyrs for philosophy that goes back at least to Socrates. A few months hence, he would commit suicide <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/newPost#_ftn2\">[2]</a> in his cell after leaving his hideout and getting caught by the Jacobins.</p><span><figure><img src=\"https://dnq5fc8vfw3ev.cloudfront.net/thumbs/aspect-normal-normal/248000/248536/Fragonard,-Alexandre-Evariste/The-Death-Of-Condorcet-In-Prison-On-28th-March.jpg?ts=1505655060\" class=\"draft-image default\" style=\"width:67%\" /></figure></span><p><em>Condorcet found dead in his cell.</em></p><p></p><p>Despite these unlucky circumstances, Condorcet was not one to lament his fortune and procrastinate in his last days. It was in this period that he wrote perhaps his greatest work, the optimistic <em>Sketch for a Historical Picture of the Progress of the Human Mind.</em> </p><p>In this typical expression of Enlightenment optimism, he argued that an improved understanding of the world would lead to economic, social and moral progress:</p><blockquote>Our hopes, as to the future condition of the human species, may be reduced to three points: the <strong>destruction of inequality between different nations</strong>; the <strong>progress of equality in one and the same nation</strong>; and lastly, the <strong>real improvement of man</strong>.</blockquote><p>Condorcet was building on rather eventful two decades in which he haactively hastening this progress. In the 1770&#x27;s, he had decided to leave the pleasant world of abstract mathematics. Along with his fellow French <em>philosophes</em>, as well as his foreign friends and pen friends \u2013 Benjamin Franklin, Adam Smith, Thomas Jefferson - he used Enlightenment reasoning based on logic, science and universal humanism to find flaws in conventional wisdom. </p><span><figure><img src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a1/Bouchedefer.jpg\" class=\"draft-image \" style=\"\" /></figure></span><p><em>The Mouth of Iron, the newsletter of  Condorcet&#x27;s <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society_of_the_Friends_of_Truth\">Society of the Friends of the Truth</a> - a predecessor to the EA Forum and LessWrong</em></p><p></p><p>This led him to endorse and act on a number of fringe ideas:</p><p> - He founded the <em>Society of the Friends of Blacks</em> in the 1780\u2019s and was a key thinker in the abolitionist movement.</p><p> - Along with his brilliant wife Sophie, he was one of the first advocates of women\u2019s suffrage. His essay <em>On the Admission of Women to the Rights of Citizenship </em>laid the intellectual foundations for early feminist thought.</p><p> - Despite his aristocratic background, he was an active advocate of democracy and one of the key figures in the French Revolution (before being labeled as too moderate).</p><p> - He was perhaps the first quantitative social scientists and laid the foundations for thinking about the <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/podcast/episodes/aaron-hamlin-voting-reform/\">designs of social systems</a> that best reflect the preferences of all people.</p><p>In short, Condorcet got almost everything right. He was also part of a broader intellectual movement that managed to identify many flaws in commonsense morality and spark a cultural and institutional change around the world \u2013 from the gradual abolition of slave trade and slavery to the spread of democracies. The Enlightenment.</p><span><figure><img src=\"http://www.datapointed.net/media/2010/11/republic_of_letters_tool.png\" class=\"draft-image left\" style=\"\" /></figure></span><p><em>The Republic of Letters visualized by Stanford data scientists</em></p><h2>K\u00f6nigsberg</h2><p>To the east, in the Prussian town of  K\u00f6nigsberg, the banner of the Enlightenment was held by a very different thinker \u2013 one Immanuel Kant. Although he never ventured far from  his hometown, the same cannot be said for his ideas. From philosophy departments to the <em>Universal Declaration of Human Rights, </em>they are still making a lasting impact on the world.</p><span><figure><img src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/43/Immanuel_Kant_%28painted_portrait%29.jpg/230px-Immanuel_Kant_%28painted_portrait%29.jpg\" class=\"draft-image \" style=\"width:22%\" /></figure></span><p>Kant&#x27;s contemporary, Johann Herder, describes how he challenged others to think about the important problems of their time:</p><blockquote><em>Speech, the richest in thought, flowed from his lips. Playfulness, wit and humour were at his command. . . . No cabal, no sect, no prejudice, no desire for fame could ever tempt him in the slightest way from broadening and illuminating the truth. He <strong>incited and forced others to think for themselves</strong>; despotism was foreign to his mind.</em></blockquote><p>The &quot;playfulness, wit and humour&quot; are often easy to miss in his writings<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/newPost#_ftn3\">[3]</a>. But his intellectual track record is certainly impressive.</p><span><figure><img src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f1/Kant-Denkmal_K%C3%B6nigsberg_%281._Platz%29.JPG\" class=\"draft-image default\" style=\"width:65%\" /></figure></span><p>Like Condorcet, Kant managed to identify and advocate for progress on some of the non-obvious causes of his time. He defended democracy (back then it needed defending). He was an early advocate of global cooperation on causes like trade and peace. And perhaps most importantly, he defended the Enlightenment values themselves. </p><p>Kant\u2019s defense of the use of reason and science as vehicles for the improvement of the human condition shines through in his essay <em>What is Enlightenment</em>. He traces the essence of the body of thought to independent thinking unencumbered by pressures from authorities or the supernatural:</p><blockquote><em>Enlightenment is man&#x27;s emergence from his self-imposed immaturity. Immaturity is the inability to use one&#x27;s own understanding without another&#x27;s guidance. This immaturity is self-imposed if its cause lies not in lack of understanding but in indecision and lack of courage to use one&#x27;s own mind without another&#x27;s guidance. <strong>Dare to know!</strong></em> <em><strong>(Sapere aude.) &quot;Have the courage to use your own understanding,&quot; is therefore the motto of the enlightenment.</strong></em></blockquote><p>In some cases, this independent thought paid off. However, at other times, his moral compass failed to point him to the trend of the expanding circle of moral concern. For instance, he believed that \u201c<em>wives, servants, and children are possessed in a way akin to our possession of objects</em>.\u201d Consequently, they <em>\u201cshould not be permitted to vote or take an active role in the affairs of state</em>\u201d. </p><p>He held similar views on homosexuality. In his opinion, it was an <em>&quot;unmentionable vice&quot;</em> so wrong that <em>&quot;there are no limitations whatsoever that can save [it] from being repudiated completely&quot;.</em>  </p><p></p><span><figure><img src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/64/Adolph_Menzel_-_Fl%C3%B6tenkonzert_Friedrichs_des_Gro%C3%9Fen_in_Sanssouci_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg/440px-Adolph_Menzel_-_Fl%C3%B6tenkonzert_Friedrichs_des_Gro%C3%9Fen_in_Sanssouci_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg\" class=\"draft-image \" style=\"width:69%\" /></figure></span><p><em>Kant&#x27;s king Frederick the Great would probably beg to disagree with Kant&#x27;s account of the moral status of homosexuals.</em></p><p></p><h2>Kant&#x27;s Failure</h2><p>Kant\u2019s failure gives me a pause \u2013 if one of the greatest moral philosophers in history made such massive mistakes, how likely is it that I am not making similar ones? </p><p>In his thesis <em>On the Overwhelming Importance of Shaping the Far Future, </em>Nick Beckstead pithily summarizes the same concern:</p><blockquote>1. In the past, there was widespread, correlated, biased moral error, even on matters where people were very confident.</blockquote><blockquote>2. By induction, we make similar errors, even on matters where we are very confident.</blockquote><p>In other words, if history is a guide, then future generations will almost certainly consider some of my beliefs and actions atrocious. But which ones? Is there a way to get closer to Condorcet&#x27;s track record in terms of anticipating moral progress?</p><p>It would be extremely useful to get a visit from the future and receive a prioritized list of the most important blind spots. Short of that opportunity, I will try a different exercise: I will imagine visiting Kant in K\u00f6nigsberg and trying to talk him out of his parochial views. And hope that I learn something along the way.</p><p>Such a quest might be far from trivial. Finding knock-down logical arguments that would resonate with Kant would likely be a Sisyphean task.</p><p>But I would be at least mildly optimistic. While both Kant and I are both a far cry from the proverbial &quot;ideal Bayesian reasoner&quot;, we are committed to the same core principles\u2013to changing our beliefs if they don\u2019t hold up against reason and empirical observation. </p><p>I could therefore take a less direct approach: undermine Kant&#x27;s confidence in his moral judgments - both his intuitive gut responses and the more explicit, analytical ones  - by pointing him to some of the most glaring failure modes of both.</p><p>And in doing so, I would be able to work with more than two centuries of science that directly builds on the Enlightenment foundations laid by Kant, Condorcet and others.</p><p>I could also use Kant\u2019s explicit commitment to putting his money where his mouth is:</p><blockquote><em>The usual touchstone, <strong>whether that which someone asserts is merely his persuasion \u2014 or at least his subjective conviction, that is, his firm belief \u2014 is betting</strong>. It often happens that someone propounds his views with such positive and uncompromising assurance that he seems to have entirely set aside all thought of possible error. A bet disconcerts him.</em></blockquote><p>Turning abstract philosophical arguments into empirical statements about how human moral judgment works in different circumstances (and betting on them, in case of disagreement) could thus turn a frustrating process into a win-win situation: either you win money or a more accurate belief.</p><p>Indeed, evolutionary, moral, social and cognitive psychology have uncovered a few things that should make anyone - even Kant - leave their <em>uncompromising assurance </em>and seriously consider the possibility of major error.</p><p>As an appetizer, I would show Kant the series<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/sequences/bQgRsy23biR52poMf\"> No-nonsense metaethics</a> by Luke Muehlhauser which provides a summary of some surprising findings from moral psychology and neuroscience:</p><ul><li><em><strong>Our moral judgments are significantly affected by whether we are in the presence of freshly baked bread </strong>or a low concentration of f<strong>art spray </strong>that only the subconscious mind can detect.</em></li><li><em>Our moral judgments are greatly affected by p<strong>ointing magnets </strong>at the point in our brain that processes theory of mind.</em></li><li><em>[\u2026]</em></li><li><em> People give h<strong>arsher moral judgments when they feel clean.</strong></em></li></ul><p>And there is much more. I think Kant would probably come away be excited about how the Enlightenment project turned out.</p><h2>Further reading </h2><p><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/sequences/bQgRsy23biR52poMf\">No-nonsense metaethics</a> by Luke Muehlhauser</p><p><em><a href=\"https://rucore.libraries.rutgers.edu/rutgers-lib/40469/PDF/1/play/\">On the Overwhelming Importance of Shaping the Far Future</a> </em>by Nick Beckstead</p><p><em><a href=\"https://www.effectivealtruism.org/articles/three-heuristics-for-finding-cause-x/\">Three Heuristics for Finding Cause X </a></em>by Kerry Vaughan</p><p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH2LhSod1M4\">Keynote by Will MacAskill and Toby Ord</a>, EA Global 2016</p><p>---</p><p><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/newPost#_ftnref1\">[1]</a> His speech at the constitutional convention was only the last in the series of his crimes.

In the past, participants have seemed to find it especially helpful for someone with standing in the community to speak about difficult experiences / depression / anxiety they\u2019ve had, as it makes clear that it really is ok to talk about these things.)</p><p>At that point, people usually have a lot to say and the conversation flows pretty easily.</p><p>One possible structured activity to include is an adaptation of the <a href=\"https://www.mind.org.uk/media/4229239/mind-guide-for-line-managers-wellness-action-plans_final.pdf\">Wellness Action Plan</a> from Mind (a mental health nonprofit). The guide is on page 15 and can be adapted to be about \"friends\" rather than \"manager\" and \"when doing activism / when involved in the EA community\" rather than \"at work,\" etc.</p><h2>Other tips </h2><ul><li>We suggest keeping the focus on \"self care\" and/or \u201cgetting support\" rather than \"mental health.\u201d Topics around mental health will naturally arise, but this way the topic can also encompass experiences that don't fall within the category of an illness.</li><li>People will express very different things, sometimes things that directly contradict each other\u2019s experiences. It can be helpful for the moderator to do a little summarizing that makes it clear it\u2019s ok to have different experiences: \u201cIt sounds like even though that\u2019s been helpful for some people, you've found it's not what worked for you.\u201d<br><br>Similarly, it can be helpful to discourage advice giving directed at a particular person as this may not be very useful, and can make people feel judged and uncomfortable.</li><li>Make sure it is clear that there's choice about how to participate. Use the language of invitation throughout. \"You are invited to share if you wish...\" rather than \"Can everyone share a thing ... \" </li><li>Consider splitting some of the session into small groups of 4-5, especially if you have group facilitators. This can help create a space where everyone can share.</li><li>Consider focusing the discussions. For example, a chunk of time for only talking about difficulties and struggles, and then a separate time for talking about things you have tried that have helped. </li><li>A show of hands: \"Who has feelings of [imposter syndrome, not doing enough, guilt for looking after yourself first, etc], please raise your hands\" is a powerful way of letting people know that they are not alone and that everyone has these feelings.</li><li>Sometimes in sessions like this people speak about deep/serious personal experiences. Don't expect people to make obvious progress on these in the session \u2014 the purpose of the session is not problem-solving, but people knowing that they can talk about the hard parts of their lives with their EA community.</li><li>If someone opens up a lot emotionally, we suggest having an organizer speak with them one-on-one at the end of the session, thank them for sharing, and offer to check in about how they\u2019re feeling before they depart. Someone who\u2019s shared deeply may be feeling uncertain about whether they did the right thing. It may be useful for them to hear reassurance that it was ok to share, and to be able to express any lingering thoughts while not in front of a large group.</li><li>Think about what you'd do if things surface that make you concerned about someone's safety. E.g. Julia once participated in a similar session in a different community where a person disclosed that they were essentially stalking someone. No one in the group really knew what to do. In retrospect I think we should have had someone with designated responsibility for following up, along the lines of, \"I hear what a tough time you're going through, but the way you're treating this other person sounds really concerning.\" Likewise if you're concerned about the safety of someone in the session, be sure that someone checks in with them afterwards.</li><li>There has been particular good attendance and feedback where these kind of support events have been bolted onto other events (conferences, retreats, etc.)</li></ul><h2>End of session</h2><p>It is good to end with a summary of what support is available.</p><ul><li><em>Anyone can talk to me privately after the event if they would find that helpful.</em></li><li><em>This session should not be considered in anyway a replacement for professional support. If you are feeling like you cannot be happy, feeling suicidal, or are struggling with day to day activities, then please do consider professional medical support [how to seek professional medical support in your country].</em></li><li><em>Julia Wise works for CEA, has worked in the field of mental health, and can be contacted at julia@centreforeffectivealtruism.org for further resources and support.</em></li><li><em>There is a Facebook <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/ea.peer.support\">peer support group</a>.</em></li><li><em><a href=\"https://www.mentalhealthnavigator.co.uk/\">EA Mental Health Navigator</a> service, with list of providers recommended by others.</em></li></ul><p><em>Anyone else have general advice to share?</em></p><p>Plan for some lighter social time (snacks, unstructured chatting) afterwards so people have some time to adjust if needed before going home.</p><p>Repeat the resources above in a written form after the event (like a followup email or FB post).</p><h2>Past sessions</h2><p><u><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/11js2aH7WqfamSqS7UUYeJOpp8htMZlg2zedzdgJpMFo/edit\">Notes</a></u> from session at EAGx Netherlands 2018.</p><p><u><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1irdHi21MTuh1FWgjsi08smMRgQxvpO0wVtJuWD77Zww/edit\">Notes</a></u> from session at EA Global London 2017. </p>", "user": {"username": "Julia_Wise"}}, {"_id": "nrDu9B8rKjJ2Kc5GK", "title": "Which piece got you more involved in EA?", "postedAt": "2018-09-06T07:25:01.218Z", "htmlBody": "<p>The EA Forum team is currently thinking about what core content we&#x27;d like most new effective altruists to engage with.

"<p><em>Meta: This is a draft of a paid book review commissioned by CEA. The purposes of the commission include being used as a potential starting point for discussion on the new EA forum.</em></p><p><em>The book being reviewed is Jonathan Haidt&#x27;s </em>The Righteous Mind<em>, released in 2012. The review is split into two parts. The first part summarizes the book, and the second offers commentary.</em></p><p><em>Feedback for this draft is welcome, about either form or content.</em></p><h2>Summary</h2><p><strong>In one sentence:</strong> </p><p>You might think that your moral judgments are reasoned, but they are really driven by the \u201celephant\u201d of our moral intuition, with reasons coming afterwards.</p><p><strong>In one paragraph:</strong></p><p>Haidt makes three claims, using three metaphors:</p><ol><li><strong>The Elephant and the Rider:</strong> It feels like reason (the elephant rider) is driving our moral judgements, but in fact, our reactions to moral questions seem to be determined by intuitive judgements (the elephant). Reason is mainly used to justify and support those intuitive judgements.</li><li><strong>Moral Taste Receptors: </strong>Haidt sets out 5 moral tastes (Care, Fairness, Loyalty, Authority, Sanctity). He claims that different people and groups have different \u201ctaste receptors\u201d: for instance, that liberals care mostly about Care and Fairness, while conservatives have a more even split between all 5 taste receptors. </li><li><strong>90% Chimp, 10% Bee:</strong> We are mostly individualistic chimps, but we also have some capacity to absorb ourselves into a collective project, or \u201chive\u201d. Haidt claims that this capacity allows us to cooperate, and avoid free rider problems. But are cooperative tendencies are often limited to some parochial hive, rather than the collective good: Haidt thinks that the best we can aspire to may be \u201cparochial altruism\u201d for those we are close to, rather than universal cooperation.</li></ol><p><strong>In one page:</strong></p><p><em>The Righteous Mind</em> is organized into three parts. </p><p>In the first part, Haidt discusses the development of moral reasoning. On Haidt\u2019s account, humans build morality from a tangle of intuition, rather than consciously assembling a moral edifice. Though parents play some role in teaching and reinforcing behaviors, children largely create their moralities in play with other children (p. 6), as they try things out and discover which conventions are enforced and how. Thus, children\u2019s morality is influenced by what is allowed in the culture they grow up in. However, this influence is not absolute: some boundaries seem to be universal and innate. For example, children tend to think that harming people is wrong, even if the harm is allowed (p. 10).</p><p>On Haidt\u2019s view, morality is partly cultural and partly innate, but above all intuitive; we figure out instantly if something seems morally off, then seek justification. In Haidt\u2019s lab, he would start by asking his subjects why incest was wrong. Then he would shift the ground of the question to undermine the reasons they gave: if they said that siblings shouldn\u2019t have sex because of the risk of genetic abnormalities, he would ask them whether it would still be wrong if the siblings were infertile. If they worried about power dynamics, he would ask them to assume that they were both enthusiastically consenting. But as they gradually ran out of reasons, their faith in incest\u2019s immorality was usually not shaken. Intuition, rather than reason, was determining what they thought.</p><p>According to Haidt\u2019s results, once the \u201celephant\u201d of intuition has chosen its path, it is very difficult for the \u201crider\u201d of rationality to change its course (p. 40). In other words, undermining someone\u2019s explicit reasoning is very unlikely to change their mind on moral matters.</p><p>In the book\u2019s second part, Haidt samples moral variety. He describes a taxonomy of \u201cmoral foundations\u201d, which he likens to different sorts of taste receptors on the tongue. Different people, cultures, and political coalitions have different moral tastes, using some receptors more than others. Which of these flavors are more appealing to liberals, and which to conservatives?</p><ol><li><strong>Care/harm:</strong> it is bad to cause harm, and good to take care of one\u2019s charges, especially children (p. 131-134).</li><li><strong>Fairness/cheating: </strong>it is bad to lie, cheat, and exploit others, and good to make and honor mutually beneficial agreements (p. 134-138).</li><li><strong>Loyalty/betrayal:</strong>  it is good to respect and positively view one\u2019s own tribe/team, and not betray its interests to favor oneself or outgroups (p. 138-141).</li><li><strong>Authority/subversion:</strong> it is good to respect the social order, and bad to be insubordinate to justified authorities (p. 142-145).</li><li><strong>Sanctity/degradation:</strong> it is good to perform purifying rituals to avoid contaminants both physical and abstract, and bad to allow contamination to set in (p. 146-153).</li></ol><p>The first two foundations are savored by liberals, to the (partial) exclusion of the other three. Conservatives, by contrast, tend to experience all five.</p><p>In a different chapter, Haidt also proposes a sixth, more speculative foundation: the <strong>liberty/oppression </strong>foundation. On his view, this foundation explains the moral fervor of revolutionaries, as well as the extreme preference for freedom shared by libertarians. On Haidt\u2019s view, this foundation likely emerged as a coordination mechanism for early humans to take down bullies and keep them from using superior physical strength to dominate their tribes (p. 171-172). Counting this foundation as shared by liberals and conservatives, liberals are sensitive to three moral tastes, while conservatives prefer six.</p><p>Not only do liberals prefer to define on a smaller set of behaviors as morally salient, there are cases where certain liberals prefer to focus just on <em>one </em>favored taste. Haidt notices that in certain WEIRD cultures - Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic ones - people tend to provide moral reasons exclusively in terms of care/harm: if something is intuitively bad but victimless, people in more individualistic WEIRD cultures may be forced to admit that nothing immoral happened (or else invent a victim). In cultures that are less WEIRD, it is more common for something to be declared wrong because it violates sanctity norms: morality is more than wellbeing (p. 95-98).</p><p>Haidt acknowledges that his grouping is just one way to organize our fluid moral impulses - these five tastes (and later six) became salient to him during his research, but there might be other ways to understand moral flavours.</p><p>In the book\u2019s final part, Haidt describes human beings as \u201c90% chimp and 10% bee\u201d. We are partly selfish, but under the right circumstances, we can melt into group identities and feel like a mere part of a greater whole. He believes that this ability to act as a hive is largely responsible for humans\u2019 ability to devote themselves to the group, and avoid free rider problems (p. 244-245). Haidt sees this ability to form hives, to melt into group identities, as a way to access transcendent happiness. At the same time, it makes us more parochial: we find it hard to be selfless to the world more generally, so instead we devote ourselves to some smaller group. Haidt believes that <em>parochial altruism</em>, rather than universal love, may be all we can aspire to (p. 244-245).</p><h2>Commentary</h2><p>Hadit\u2019s claims about moral foundations theory are supported by his own research, as are his claims about how people respond to moral ideas intuitively first and rationally second. Many of his other claims, however, are more like grand narratives or surveys of historical thought. Haidt defends ideas as broad as group selection and as old as Glaucon\u2019s case for appearances over moral substance in Plato\u2019s <em>Republic</em>. His grand narratives are difficult to falsify, though it is possible to question their backing.</p><p>There is a <u><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replication_crisis#In_psychology\">replication crisis</a></u> in psychology, and <em>The Righteous Mind </em>was released in 2012, so it is reasonable to make sure that the book isn\u2019t on too shaky ground. Overall, the case is mixed. Moral foundations theory has <u><a href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/rabble-rouser/201602/are-most-published-social-psychology-findings-false\">apparently replicated</a></u>, while part two of <u><a href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/rabble-rouser/201602/are-most-published-social-psychology-findings-false\">this excellent review</a></u> by Zach Jacobi suggests that the evidence for intuitionism is mixed. Overall, <em>The Righteous Mind </em>does not seem to have fared too badly. Assuming there is something to Haidt\u2019s combination of historical narrative, modern research survey, and original models, how can we respond to it?</p><p>Many people feel like they and their friends are mostly rational, while their ideological opponents are irrational. But doing the most good possible requires understanding the world, and that means you must be able to confront your <em>own </em>irrationality.  Scope insensitivity causes people to place a <u><a href=\"https://www.rti.org/sites/default/files/resources/bk-0001-1009_web.pdf\">similar</a></u> value on saving 2,000 birds and saving 20,000 birds, when clearly the latter is about ten times more valuable than the former. To save more birds, or effectively solve any of the problems we face, we need to <u><a href=\"http://slatestarcodex.com/2013/05/02/if-its-worth-doing-its-worth-doing-with-made-up-statistics/\">make models</a></u>, instead of being led only by our emotional reactions. Effective altruism is about trying to build a more rational approach to doing good, which requires fighting our biases. </p><p>But can we even fight our biases? <em>The Righteous Mind </em>makes a quite concerning claim: we would like to think that human beings are basically rational but prone to biases. On Haidt\u2019s account, however, we are basically intuitive and use rationality only to justify the intuition. So on Haidt\u2019s model, we still can\u2019t trust someone who is aware of many biases and statistical methods - we\u2019d expect them to make <u><a href=\"http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/08/14/beware-isolated-demands-for-rigor/\">isolated demands for rigor</a></u>, create models that are unconsciously weighted to provide their desired result, and elevate the sorts of things their ingroups do to a special moral status. This view of the world - that elephants rule and riders can only passively assist them - is pretty bleak, and itself unintuitive. Most people can remember changing their minds sometimes, and even simple tasks like budgeting or going on a diet involve using long-term planning to overcome intuitive desires (like buying whatever you want, or eating tons of very sugary food). We won\u2019t get anywhere seeing ourselves as helpless and unable to be reasonable <em>at all</em>. And besides, given that arguments do change our minds on some things sometimes, the idea that riders are powerless isn\u2019t strictly true. So what can we do?</p><p>There are a few ways to respond to Haidt here, for someone interested in optimizing for metrics other than intuitive pull:</p><ol><li><strong>Take intuitionism seriously,</strong> and work to compromise with and accommodate our intuitive apparatuses. This would look like taking time to figure out intuitive wants, offering small rewards for otherwise unappealing good habits (like eating a piece of candy every time after going to the gym), and being willing to take otherwise suboptimal courses of action for the sake of satisfying basic drives. Paul Christiano discusses this approach, among other things, in an excellent <u><a href=\"https://sideways-view.com/2017/02/19/the-monkey-and-the-machine-a-dual-process-theory/\">blog post</a></u>.</li><li><strong>Try to use rationality to overcome irrationality,</strong> and find ways to correct for bias that co-opt intuition. For example, make reasonably high-stakes bets on claims. If these bets are incorrect, then the material loss will provide negative feedback for the elephant, which provides an incentive for accuracy (rather than, for example, accidentally holding beliefs that are likely to make you look good).</li><li><strong>Respect the elephant.</strong> Even if we work hard to become more rational, we can be extra careful about the sorts of things that are likely to change our elephant\u2019s direction. If certain beliefs are highly correlated with social status or material reward, for example, we should expect our biases to be much more powerful than usual. We should expect to need novel, elephant-tailored methods to defuse them, such as privately journaling about these ideas so that social feedback is less likely to be a consideration, or discussing them with people in a separate peer group that does not confer status for those beliefs.</li><li><strong>Explore morality collectively: </strong>Haidt\u2019s recommendation is to engage robustly with the best peer groups we can find. Even if we can\u2019t easily alter our own intuitions, the claims of people we trust and respect can modulate our views, and average group views <u><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/The-Wisdom-Crowds-James-Surowiecki/dp/0385721706?tag=tedspeakers-20\">may tend to be</a></u> more accurate than idiosyncratic ones.</li></ol><p>A final implication of Haidt\u2019s work is that we should learn to respect and talk to other people\u2019s elephants. When an array of logical arguments fails, an intuitive (but still honest) reframing may help make data much more palatable.</p><p><em>The Righteous Mind </em>is well worth reading, especially for people interested in group psychology or political intractability. </p>", "user": {"username": "Justis"}}, {"_id": "Y2iqhjAHbXNkwcS8F", "title": "How to use the Forum", "postedAt": "2018-09-05T17:22:55.831Z", "htmlBody": "<p><strong>As of April 2022, this has been replaced by </strong><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/s/s5zDhfyRPvrpeuRf8\"><strong>the new \"How to use the Forum\" sequence</strong></a><strong>.&nbsp;</strong></p><hr><p><i>If any information on this page seems inaccurate, or you think we should add something that isn't here, please </i><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/about#Support\"><i>let us know</i></a><i>.

Following on the heels of critics who have condemned EA for emphasizing charity over the political cause of revising international markets and political institutions along leftist lines, Ashford takes a more constructive approach to the matter, attempting to revise EA and place it in a position of compatibility. Woodruff fawns over the article, calling it a &quot;careful argument&quot;, &quot;a major contribution to the subject&quot; that &quot;should be widely read,&quot; so I decided to take a look.<br><br>Ashford&apos;s chapter starts by examining the divide between charity as a matter of beneficence and the alternative conception of justice. In deontological ethics, beneficence is our requirement to be altruistic and generous, placing value in other people&apos;s interests. Justice is our requirement to ensure that people&apos;s rights are not violated, and to make compensation where appropriate. She treats EA&apos;s welfare consequentialism as pushing beneficence, and attempts to show why justice is more appropriate for both conceptual and practical reasons.</p>\n<h2>The conceptual argument for defining EA as a matter of justice</h2>\n<p>Ashford describes the manner in which Western governments and companies have done things to deny well-deserved economic rights to the people and states of the developing world, to build global institutions that fail to appropriately take their interests into account, and to outright rob them. She mentions issues such as colonial resource extraction and disparate impact of climate change which are clearly real and clearly unjust. Overall, she succeeds in showing that multiple past and present policies have violated the rights of the global poor. Then she paints a conception of our resulting obligations which dodges the non-identity problem and other moral objections by arguing that the wealth itself comes with obligations to be returned to its rightful owners, rather than appealing to the more simplistic idea that wealthy people themselves are guilty.<br><br>This is all assuming that one believes in a rights-first approach, of course. The argument can be reconstructed as follows:<br><br>(1) Human rights exist as right- and wrong-making features of the world.<br>(2) If a practice violates human rights, then the benefits of that practice rightfully belong to those whose rights were violated.<br>(3) The manner in which global institutions have prolonged severe poverty constitutes a human rights violation.<br>(4) This human rights violation has contributed to our wealth.<br>&#x2234; Our wealth comes with obligations to use it to support the rights of those in severe poverty.<br><br>If someone accepts a deontological view, then (3) is easy to defend. The strict libertarian view of rights, where we have strong duties to refrain from hurting anyone but no duties to refrain from exploiting their position and leaving them without the means of subsistence, is generally considered flawed these days, as the tension between those respectively strong and lax duties is hard to defend and it violates our general ethical concern for the interests of the poor. It&apos;s hard to give a comprehensive account of rights that doesn&apos;t say that the systematic application of power politics to disproportionately benefit the West is permissible. And several of Ashford&apos;s examples of injustice are simple examples of unequivocal theft.<br><br>But most consequentialists will obviously deny (1), in which case the argument fails. A rights-based consequentialism would suffice, but then it would run afoul of (2), because it would have us confer benefits towards wherever they can assure the most rights, not necessarily to whoever was initially cheated of those benefits. A retributivist consequentialist could appeal to moral guilt to establish that we deserve less wealth, but since Ashford&apos;s argument about the causes of poverty does not establish moral guilt for the average person, that does not work here either.</p>\n<h2>The practical implications of viewing EA as a matter of justice</h2>\n<p>But in practical terms, does it matter whether we take the justice view or not? According to Ashford, the moral difference between beneficence and justice is that beneficence is a matter of resources that we should give, whereas distributive justice is about resources that are not rightfully ours to give in the first place. But it&apos;s hard to see a substantive difference here: under both views, we ought to give away our resources, and we have no moral right to possess them. What does it mean for something to not be morally ours to give, if it is something other than the standard idea that we are morally required to give it away? Ashford clarifies by saying that if civilization were just, then we would not have all these spare resources to give away, and distinguishes the justice view as follows:<br><br>&quot;On this framing of the issue, therefore, it calls for reform of global and domestic economic, political and legal structures, so that those currently suffering severe poverty are no longer deprived of a realistic opportunity to obtain the means of subsistence, to which they are morally entitled.&quot;<br><br>However, it&apos;s easy to see how a framing of beneficence or consequentialism could also tell us that we would not possess all these spare resources to give away if civilization were properly structured. The argument would be simple:<br><br>(1) Restructuring global and domestic economic, political and legal structures to redistribute wealth and power for the sake of the severe poor would help them gain the means of subsistence.<br>(2) This would increase the welfare of those in poverty to a degree that is sufficient to outweigh the potentially negative sum of other effects of such a reform in the long run.<br>&#x2234; Therefore, we ought to restructure global and domestic economic, political and legal structures so that we do not have these spare resources to give away.<br><br>Where, then, might the proponent of beneficence or consequentialism reach different ethical conclusions than the judicial activist? You might suggest that we imagine that we reject (1), but if so, then it is obvious that proponents of the justice view should not support reform either, because it would be actively counterproductive to the goal of granting economic justice to the poor. Only a rejection of (2) might lead to a difference in views, because a judicial activist may be obliged to sacrifice the greater good for most of the world as long as it lets them rescue the minority who are in extreme poverty. Even then, this will not work if the sacrifice of the greater good is an injustice of its own, for such a thing would not be acceptable to the deontologist. It would have to be a case where the consequences are severe in aggregate, but not an infringement upon people&apos;s rights. In that case only, the proponent of beneficence or consequentialism would oppose reform, whereas the judicial activist would support it.<br><br>This is a notable divergence, but still a narrower one than Ashford seems to think. Her chapter glides over the potential consequentialist demand for global reform as if it were not relevant. She does grant that EAs would support structural reform if the evidence and impact for such efforts seemed strong enough, but does not connect this tacit understanding of our moral framework with her claims for the difference in implications for beneficence and justice. Instead, she moves past this clear moral question to look at the soft framing of EA language and ideas. The core charge of the chapter is that, since we use words like &apos;altruism&apos; and &apos;charity&apos; with a generally simple cost-effectiveness framework, we might be encouraging people to ignore or reject deep arguments in favor of global reforms. We could be allocating more airtime to ideas and phrasing that emphasize other values, like &quot;rectifying injustice&quot; and &quot;repaying our moral debt&quot;, and that is liable to change people&apos;s behavior to care more about global reforms.<br><br>This is perfectly plausible, of course; framing and priming matter. But framing and priming are pragmatic issues that matter to welfare consequentialists too. We equally ought to reframe our language if that improves people&apos;s behavior to reduce poverty. So why don&apos;t we? First, we lack the sort of empirical data that is required to draw robust conclusions on this issue, and Ashford doesn&apos;t provide it. Moreover, there is a host of countervailing possibilities that Ashford does not address. If we send messages about injustice rather than altruistic impact, then it might prompt people to deflect blame and responsibility to governments, corporations and the very wealthy without them doing anything on their own except for the occasional throwaway vote to a third party. It might prompt them to donate to charities that appeal to their sentiments without actually being effective. It might prompt them to unthinkingly support bad economic and political policies that do more harm than good. It also might prompt them to ignore important causes that don&apos;t directly address the global poor, like x-risk. So neither side here has a monopoly on arguments about the negative effects of framing, and the advocate of justice should conversely be open to adopting the benevolent framing since it might better succeed in restoring the economic rights of the poor. Moreover, we have clearly seen that many people do use justice concerns as a tool to condemn EA, to weasel their way out of demands to donate to charity, or to motivate idealistic support for dubious economic views. <br><br>So the question of framing is largely pragmatic, unsolved, and independent of whether we really believe that charity should be a matter of beneficence or justice - much like the question of international reform. How, then, might the justice view carry practical ramifications? Certainly, the justice view does not absolve one of the requirement to donate to charities that directly alleviate poverty. Ashford takes great pains to establish that we still have judicial obligations to donate to effective charities. She casts EA efforts as a duty of last resort; while it is the least preferable way to grant rights to a person, it is also the most urgent, for no reform will come quick enough to save the people who are currently in a crisis of subsistence. Ashford&apos;s designation for this type of obligation - a &quot;backup duty&quot; - belies her view that it constitutes a robust and heavy burden upon us to extensively donate our money, one that coexists with our obligations to reform global economic and political systems.<br><br>But Ashford takes a disappointing shortcut in ignoring the conflict between these two subsets of the duty to achieve justice. The inability to adjudicate among conflicting duties has long been considered a major flaw of deontological ethics, and in the context of Effective Altruism this problem is easy to see. I have only one career, and a limited amount of money. Should I use all of it to reform the world? Or all of it to support aid? Or some of each? Whereas consequentialism has a simple answer to this question and reduces it to an empirical matter, Ashford offers no alternative. She generally seems to think that one must do both, but that is a non sequitur: just because I have pro tanto reasons to do two competing things doesn&apos;t mean that I must divide my efforts between both of them; perhaps one pro tanto reason is generally stronger than the other and so it warrants all my efforts, even though I nominally support both causes. In the realm of careers and volunteering, we are usually more effective in changing the world when we focus on one issue, due to the nature of career specialization and comparative advantage. And only one charity will make the most effective use of my donations. This problem could also constitute a retort from the critics that Ashford is attempting to bring into the fold: aid money is money that we could be using to buy political influence, so it&apos;s not obviously the best thing to spend on.</p>\n<p>Whether we seek to alleviate poverty directly or indirectly, we might suppose that such efforts will get a privileged status over very different cause areas if we endorse the justice view. But our other cause priorities deal with injustices too; factory farming is an unjust emergency, and an existential catastrophe would clearly be a massive injustice that might only be prevented if we act now. And just like poverty, both of these problems have been furthered by selfish and corrupt international institutions which have also contributed to our wealth. So it&apos;s not really clear if the justice view might change much in our approach to cause prioritization.<br><br>Whatever demands are implied by the justice view, it&apos;s not a foregone conclusion that all of our donations must be made in accordance with them. Ashford does not clarify or defend the extent of the restitution demanded by a concern for justice. There are good reasons to think that it is far from the totality of our disposable income. First, one might point out that a variety of Western wealth-making practices have helped the developing world as well. This includes mutually beneficial international trade, the transfer of technology and knowledge, extensive infrastructure construction, access to global capital markets which provide ready funding for their business ventures as well as opportunities for them to invest their wealth, norms of sovereignty and institutions for the resolution of international disputes, mutually beneficial laws and institutions regulating worldwide travel and communication, pressure on governments to better recognize the rights of their people, military missions to stop insurgency and piracy, and training local governments to empower them to stop such threats on their own. The list of ways by which the institutions and policies associated with Western hegemony have benefited the global poor is very long, and the results can be seen by looking at overall changes in quality of life and poverty rates for the developing world since the time of their contact with the West. <br><br>Moreover, much of our wealth does not come from relations with the developing world at all. Western economic development has been supported by a variety of internal factors in social organization, governance, technology, labor productivity, and domestic resource extraction, and it&apos;s not clear how this wealth comes with any strings attached to give it away. One might argue that it is associated with injustice towards people *within* the West, but since poverty in the West is not a human rights violation, Ashford&apos;s argument does not apply. <br><br>To be clear, Ashford&apos;s moral argument is resilient to these two claims. On a rights view, good events typically don&apos;t &quot;count for&quot; bad ones. If I benefit someone 2-3 times and then harm them 2-3 times, I have still dealt them an injustice, and I am still responsible for compensating them. The people of the global South did not consent to accepting this complex package of rights establishment and denial. That being said, just because harms have not been repaid doesn&apos;t mean that the harms generate a moral claim to all of our wealth. It seems that the most appropriate choice is to look at the proportion of our wealth that is attributable to relations with the developing world, and then take the proportion of the resulting quantity which corresponds to the proportion of our relations that have been unjust. How much is the resulting figure? 2%? 20%? I don&apos;t know. Regardless, any remaining disposable money presumably belongs to the demands of beneficence rather than justice.</p>\n<h2>Ashford&apos;s Responses to Objections Against EA</h2>\n<p>In any case, I don&apos;t think Ashford intends for her framework to require much in the way of radical revision to EA practices. Her main thesis is that her framework enables her to recast Effective Altruism in a new light that will more successfully rebuff its critics on various issues. But her following sequence of responses to objections against EA is somewhat farcical for the way that the exact same ideas that Effective Altruists affirm through a thin welfare consequentialist framework are repainted with her injustice framework, combined with contentious empirical assumptions and presented as novel solutions to the issue. Ashford&apos;s main strategy for responding to criticisms about potential adverse macro-level impacts of charity on the global system is to nod, voice openness to considering the potential mechanisms by which they might be validated, point to the empirical facts about how EA charities often demonstrably refrain from contributing to such problems, suggest that using language that evokes a concern for justice can dodge them otherwise, and then say that aid efforts are morally crucial in their own right. But all of this basic logic works fine with welfare consequentialism and beneficence as our moral principles. On one hand, this technically a strong facet of Ashford&apos;s argument, since it makes it independent of disagreement with her moral arguments. You can be a committed consequentialist, but you will still have to think about the possibility that different language and framing will have better results. But on the other hand, Ashford misconstrues EA and carries a pernicious implication that her responses are made compelling by the assumption of a particular political stance rather than the fundamental logic of tradeoffs, rigorous methodology, and welfare maximization which was established by EA years ago. <br><br>For instance, she responds to the idea that EA has an inappropriate normative framing by saying that, if it frames things as a matter of justice, &quot;it need not be thereby committed to the view that the money rightfully belongs to us. Rather it can be framed as simply asking the question of what we ought to do with the money that is currently, de facto, in our possession.&quot; But committal to the view that the money rightfully belongs to us is not a part of EA, which is perfectly understood as being a pragmatic philosophy about what we ought to do with the money that is de facto in our possession. There are some who espouse moral demandingness, like Singer, and some who often avoid making moral demands in order to make more positive appeals, like MacAskill; the latter still does not say that it is merely supererogatory to donate (indeed, he calls it obligatory in his chapter of this book!). Neither figure argues that the proper political and economic system is the one that leaves us with lots of money to use however we wish. Ashford acknowledges their views, as well as the fact that we have specific pragmatic rationale for talking positively and supportively about giving, as it better encourages people to donate. Her only rejoinder is to again defer the argument to be a matter of speculation about the psychological effects of framing upon people&apos;s moral beliefs, with the assumption that her pragmatic concern is more important than this other one. Yet a welfare consequentialist should just as easily affirm that the distortionary effects of positive framing have a negative impact on the world. If she is right in her empirical claims that the language of beneficence prompts people to accept existing power structures without changing them, and that changing these power structures would make the world better, then it uncontroversially counts as a reason for the welfare consequentialist to similarly oppose positive framing. So Ashford&apos;s moral disagreements with proponents of beneficence do no work here, and her answer to this criticism is no stronger than our own.<br><br>When Ashford thinks that critics are right in charging that &quot;we should not limit our moral goal to that of managing and alleviating the terrible effects of global injustice and inordinate economic inequality,&quot; she is agreeing with a criticism that rejects a viewpoint that is nowhere to be found in EA literature, as well as being outright contradicted by welfare consequentialism. On the power of NGOs to shape discourse and norms, Ashford says that beneficence framing could promote false perceptions about global poverty which inhibit the changes in norms that are necessary to eradicate poverty; on the possibility that NGOs will undermine local institutions, she states that the presence of a duty for aid requires us to cautiously support NGOs which do not significantly exhibit this effect; in both cases she is simply stating the conclusions of consequentialism with some more fashionable language. When Ashford argues that the demand for justice enables us to recognize that aid-only solutions leave people with a good deal of dependency and vulnerability, she belies the fact that welfare consequentialism adequately acknowledges the problem of such relations in virtue of the unhappiness that they cause, whereas ideal consequentialism can recognize them explicitly. Ashford suggests that the alternative to her view is to take aid as an &quot;adequate substitute for legal reforms&quot; that would &quot;exhaust the moral demands that severe poverty imposes upon us&quot;, as &quot;an adequate substitute for recognition of legally binding duties of justice owed by affluent countries&quot;, but nowhere are such views implied by beneficence, by welfare consequentialism, or by the main body of EA ideas. <br><br>There are a few other problems. In responding to the objection that our evidence-based methodology downgrades fuzzy issues like structural reform, she hypothesizes that act consequentialism cannot properly address it because it looks at individual choices whereas structural harms are a matter of interrelated patterns of behavior that must be solved in groups. But this represents a limited imagination of the way that consequentialism evaluates the world and issues moral judgements. First, consequentialism evaluates the state of the world in pure welfare terms, with no judgements on future actions being contingent upon whether one or many people caused an existing problem, so the fact that poverty was caused by a structural mechanism is irrelevant. Second, consequentialism can easily demand that we take part in the construction of a collective action if our participation has a real probability of actually achieving or strengthening that collective action. Even though our actions are considered one at a time, these actions encompass effects such as the possibility of bringing people together in making the collective action work, or the possibility of helping the collective action go further in a messy and uncertain world. Any scenario where there is no such possibility is a scenario where demanding action would be absurd. Moreover, the fact that EAs have engaged in numerous collective projects such as establishing nonprofit organizations and running conferences just as successfully as anyone else, and our readiness to chip away at other enormous collective problems such as AI existential risk and famine prevention, proves that we have no problem with the basic logic of collective action. So her prescription to look at our duty as shared is an attempt to solve a nonexistent problem.<br><br>If above I have described the good and the bad regarding Ashford&apos;s chapter, her response to MacAskill&apos;s view that sweatshop goods should not be banned or boycotted is the ugly. It is probably the most torturous section of Woodruff&apos;s entire volume. She offers a pained acknowledgement that MacAskill&apos;s argument is correct - &quot;Against that background the answer is yes, given that the alternative may be no job at all and complete destitution&quot; - but uses it as a <span>segue to </span>talk about the desirability of structural reform to the international system, despite the fact that it&apos;s clearly not the same question as the one that MacAskill was answering. She argues that MacAskill&apos;s argument answers the wrong question because it holds the international system constant, as if there is even such thing as a wrong question, and argues that he&apos;s not giving enough spotlight to the value of structural reform. But she doesn&apos;t consider the equal and opposite possibility that she or critics might not be giving enough spotlight to the value of not banning sweatshop labor instead. She argues that sweatshop labor is harmful rather than beneficial because it doesn&apos;t help workers enough to get them up to a morally acceptable standard of living, while acknowledging MacAskill&apos;s point that it helps them relative to the counterfactual, a bizarre emotive word game that will frustrate any reader who believes that morality ought to be structured with comparative preference relations rather than with absolutist value signals.</p>\n<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>\n<p>I feel divided on Ashford&apos;s chapter. If you take a rights-based morality framework, then severe poverty really is an ongoing human rights emergency, and it does require that <em>some</em> of our money be donated on the basis of justice, which <em>may</em> entail different cause priorities than those which we would normally arrive at. She is right that beneficence framing can have negative outcomes on the world. She successfully distills the morass of leftist political indignation about charity into a coherent viewpoint that is reasonably rigorous, is backed by empirical evidence, and is straightforward to discuss. She does a good job of arguing that it is crucial that we donate to aid agencies even if we accept such a framework, meaning that the overall impact of the chapter on EA&apos;s popularity will probably be positive. Ashford shows that her framework is conceptually resilient to many of the objections that have been leveled at EA, albeit only because of arguments which would serve equally well in defense of a beneficence model of EA.<br><br>But for us, the actual implications are fairly slim. Ashford&apos;s moral argument doesn&apos;t work for someone who is already committed to consequentialism. Even if you are not a consequentialist, her arguments may not demand much difference in your behavior, though we can&apos;t say for sure because Ashford&apos;s discussion of the implications of her moral principles is inadequate. It is her pragmatic arguments about framing that constitute the real core of her thesis, but she doesn&apos;t address observed and hypothesized countervailing problems that are associated with her choice of framing, nor does she address the way that framing might impact our attempts to solve other moral issues besides poverty. Her argument is also heavily dependent on psychological speculation, lacking in empirical data to support her claims about how people act or form values and beliefs in response to various framings. Therefore, she raises far more questions than she answers. Now we could speculate and argue from the armchair all day about what framing might have the best results all-things-considered, but surely the best place to start would be solid empirical surveys prompting people to respond to statements that use various types of framing, and surely the primary metric for judging this issue would be the simple question of whether or not a particular choice of framing motivates people to devote their time and money to doing good at all.</p></body></html>", "user": {"username": "kbog"}}, {"_id": "DHFMSiFj2mRD6HwXr", "title": "What Activities Do Local Groups Run", "postedAt": "2018-09-05T02:27:25.247Z", "htmlBody": "<html><body><p><span><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/y14e43Z.png?1\"></span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<h1>What Activities Do Local Groups Run</h1>\n<p>Speaking to a number of group organisers and movement builders at the recent EA Summit, it became clear that, collectively, we don&#x2019;t have a great sense of exactly what most EA groups are actually doing and how they are doing it. For example, some people I spoke to thought that most EA groups spend most of their time trying to do mass outreach, where others thought that almost no EA groups engage in mass outreach. Similarly, some thought that most groups engage primarily in unsystematic and unstructured activities (such as unstructured socials), whereas others thought that most groups ran largely structured activities. Few of us on either side had very much other than than our respective vague senses of what groups were up to back up our intuitions.</p>\n<p>This highlights the need for more systematic empirical investigation of the EA movement and local groups specifically, so that our view of the movement can be informed by something better than our vague impressions.</p>\n<p>In order to offer some insight into the question described above I report data from last year&#x2019;s Local Groups Survey (run as part of the LEAN Impact Assessment), which was not included in our previous reports.</p>\n<h2>Group Activities and Events</h2>\n<p>Out of the 98 group organisers who responded to our survey, 78 (79.6%) responded to questions about the number of events they ran of different types and the number of attendees.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>Table 1 shows the number of groups running activities of different kinds.</p>\n<div>\n<table><colgroup><col><col><col></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><span>Event Type</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>Number of Groups </span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>% of Groups </span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><span>Discussion Groups</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>59</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>76%</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><span>Speaker Events</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>58</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>74%</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><span>Socials</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>52</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>67%</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><span>Committee Meetings</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>41</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>53%</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><span>Coworking Sessions</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>21</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>27%</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><span>Career workshops</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>19</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>24%</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><span>Fundraisers</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>14</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>18%</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><span>Research Projects</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>10</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>13%</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><span>EAGx</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>7</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>9%</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n<p><span>Table 1</span></p>\n<p>These results suggest that discussion groups, speaker events and socials are the most popular events (for groups to run) by some margin, with the former two being significantly more popular than socials. Committee meetings were also run by a slim majority of groups, while the remaining event types lagged far behind with only 9-27% of groups running them at all.</p>\n<p>All in all, I take this to be somewhat suggestive that groups are primarily running events that at least have some structure and substantive content rather than only only socials. Of course, it remains to be seen how much structure and quality content is included in &#x2018;discussion groups.&#x2019;</p>\n<p>At first glance it might appear strange that only 67-76% of groups are running socials, discussion groups and speaker events (seemingly core EA group activities). However, in fact, almost all (75/78) are running at least one or some combination of these events. 2 groups in the sample had, thus far, only held committee meetings (and no public events), and 1 group reported specialising only in running research project events.</p>\n<p>Table 2 shows the total number of events of different types run across groups, rather than the total number of groups running certain types of event. For example, it might be that the same number of groups might run discussion groups and socials, but that all groups run many more social events than discussion groups.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<div>\n<table><colgroup><col><col><col></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><span>Event Type</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>Total</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>% total events run</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><span>Discussion Groups</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>543</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>28%</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><span>Socials</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>428</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>22%</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><span>Committee Meetings</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>345</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>18%</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><span>Speaker Events</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>317</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>16%</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><span>Coworking Sessions</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>233</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>12%</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><span>Career workshops</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>35</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>2%</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><span>Research Projects</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>19</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>1%</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><span>Fundraisers</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>15</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>1%</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><span>EAGx</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>7</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>0%</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n<p><span>Table 2</span></p>\n<p>This table shows a similar ordering of events, with discussion groups still dominating. Notably speaker events, despite being run by many groups, were run in smaller numbers. This is perhaps unsurprising given that speaker events are may be more costly in time and effort (and sometimes expense) to run. Notably our earlier qualitative <a href=\"/ea/1jb/2017_lean_impact_assessment_qualitative_findings/\">interviews with group leaders</a> suggested that lack of access to speakers for events was a significant bottleneck for groups. Nevertheless, organisers reported running 317 such events, which is still considerable compared to the other top event types.</p>\n<p>It is also worth noting the strikingly high number of coworking sessions run by groups. Despite only 27% of groups running these sessions (about 1/3rd as many as the number of who run discussion groups or socials), the number of coworking sessions run was more than 1/2th the number of discussion groups and social events run. This is explained by the high number of coworking events run by a small number of groups.</p>\n<p>We also collected data on the number of attendees at events across groups, shown in Table 3.</p>\n<div>\n<table><colgroup><col><col></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><span>Event Type</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>Mean Attendees</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><span>Speaker events</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>38.04</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><span>Discussion groups</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>12.51</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><span>Socials</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>11.19</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><span>Coworking</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>7.35</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><span>Committee meeting</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>5.84</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><span>Fundraisers</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>40.57</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><span>Research projects</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>9.80</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><span>Career workshops</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>42.47</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><span>EAGx</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>106.25</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n<p><span>Table 3</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p>These numbers are pretty intuitive, with speaker events, EAGx&#x2019;s, career workshops and fundraising events receiving higher numbers, committee meetings, co-working and research projects smaller numbers and discussion groups and socials receiving similar (middling) numbers of attendees. Notably, this shows that it is not the case that socials dominate other events due to receiving much higher rates of attendance. It is also worth noting that the typical size of speaker and discussion group events are both quite small, with the median number of attendees for speaker events (which might often be considered more public outreach events) being 25 and 9 attendees for both discussion groups and socials.</p>\n<h2>How Structured are Group Discussion Events?&#xA0;</h2>\n<p>To gain some insight into how structured events typically were, I ran a poll in the EA Group Organizer&#x2019;s Facebook Group asking how structured their discussion groups were. I focused on discussion groups specifically, because these were the most common event run by the largest number of groups, and because other events seemed intrinsically structured (e.g. speaker events, career workshops) and I stipulatively excluded &#x2018;purely&#x2019; social events from consideration in the poll.</p>\n<p>I included 4 options in the poll:&#xA0;</p>\n<p>1) Highly structured: following extensive, detailed pre-prepared materials (e.g. a planned curriculum or discussing an EA article in detail)</p>\n<p>2) Fairly structured: following loosely prepared materials (e.g. a significant number of specific questions about a topic are prepared, to guide discussions)</p>\n<p>3) Fairly unstructured: a general topic (Giving Now vs Giving Later) is specified, but little more is prepared</p>\n<p>4) Highly unstructured: we meet to discuss &apos;EA&apos; but don&apos;t plan anything else in advance</p>\n<p>Responses fell almost exclusively within the middle of the range

of Different Events for Group Development</h2>\n<p>In the Local Groups Survey, we also asked organisers &quot;Are there any specific opportunities that had a large impact on your group&apos;s development?&quot; (open comment). This had not been intended as explicitly discerning the importance of events relative to other factors, however, when I coded these responses, out of 35 organisers who cited some factor, 25 (71%) cited an event that they had run. Of the remainder, 3 cited external events that they had been able to attend, and 7 cited other non-event factors.</p>\n<p>Among those citing events, 8 cited speaker events, 4 giving games, 4 career workshops, 3 pledge events and 3 discussion groups. Notably, 10 explicitly mentioned the importance of outside EAs visiting their, of which 5 mentioned Peter Singer specifically.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>Besides suggesting that events are typically highly important for groups&apos; development, it also seems to suggest that a wide variety of different kinds of events are critical to the development of different groups.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Overall these numbers show that a variety of activities are supported by local groups, including primarily discussion groups, speaker events, as well as socials, with a substantial number of coworking sessions run by a small number of groups. This seems to suggest that groups are running a large number of events that are somewhat structured and contain substantive content, rather than simple socialising. Moreover, the events that groups run tend to be more structured than unstructured, though more research is required to get a clearer picture of the details of how different events are run, which events are more effective and whether events are targeted more at newer or more established EAs.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p></body></html>", "user": {"username": "David_Moss"}}, {"_id": "WmHwhR3AC5jwuH3X5", "title": "What I Learned from a Year Spent Studying How to Get Policymakers to Use Evidence", "postedAt": "2018-09-04T15:55:33.514Z", "htmlBody": "<html><body><p><em>Crossposted on zachgroff.com</em></p>\n<p>The past year I was a senior research analyst at Northwestern University&apos;s Global Poverty Research Lab on a study of evidence-based policy. Specifically, our goal was to work on a question often on researchers&apos; minds: how can I get my ideas acted upon?</p>\n<p>To do this, I dug through a number of bodies of evidence on how science influences policy. One area I looked at is what is called &quot;implementation science&quot; in medicine, which looks at how to get doctors, nurses, and hospital administrators to adopt evidence-based practice. Another was a series of papers by social scientist Carol Weiss and her students on how policymakers in government agencies claim to use evidence. There is also a small literature on how to implement evidence-based policy in public schools, and a little work on policymaker numeracy. I&apos;ve included a bibliography below that should be helpful for anyone interested in this topic.</p>\n<p>Most of my year was spent on delving into attempts to scale up specific policies, so this literature review is not as extensive as it could be. Still, while there are no knock-down bold conclusions, the research on evidence-based policy does offer a few lessons that I think anyone trying to get others to act based on evidence could use. I think this has broad applicability to people working to help others effectively, such as:</p>\n<p>&#x2014;Anyone working to promote evidence-based policy</p>\n<p>&#x2014;Researchers and those working at research organizations who are trying to get others to listen to them or trying to figure out what research to do</p>\n<p>&#x2014;Mangers in nonprofits looking to promote the use of evidence by employees</p>\n<p>&#x2014;Advocates promoting more rational behavior (e.g. giving to effective charities or considering others&apos; interests)</p>\n<p>Here is what I learned:</p>\n<p>1) Happily, evidence does seem to affect policy, but in a diffuse and indirect way. The aforementioned researcher Carol Weiss finds that large majorities (65%-89%) of policymakers report being influenced by research in their work, and roughly half of them strongly (Weiss 1980; Weiss 1977). It&apos;s rare that policymakers pick up a study and implement an intervention directly. Instead, officials gradually work evidence into their worldviews as part of a gradual process of what Weiss calls &quot;enlightenment&quot; (Weiss 1995). Evidence also influences policy in more political but potentially still benign ways by justifying existing policies, warning of problems, suggesting new policies or making policymakers appear self-critical (Weiss 1995; Weiss 1979; Weiss 1977).</p>\n<p>2) There are a few methods that seem to successfully promote evidence-based policy in health care, education, and government settings where they have been tested. The top interventions are:</p>\n<p>2a) Education&#x2014;Workshops, courses, mentorship, and review processes change decision makers&apos; behavior with regard to science in a few studies (Coburn et al. 2009; Matias 2017; Forman-Hoffman et al. 2017; Chinman et al. 2017; Hodder et al. 2017).</p>\n<p>2b) Organizational structural changes&#x2014;If an organization has evidence built into its structure, such as having a research division and hotline, encouraging and reviewing employees based on their engagement with research, and providing funding based on explicit evidence, this seems to improve the use of evidence in the organization (Coburn and Turner 2011; Coburn 2003; Coburn et al. 2009; Weiss 1980; Weiss 1995; Wilson et al. 2017; Salbach et al. 2017; Forman-Hoffman et al. 2017; Chinman et al. 2017; Hodder et al. 2017).</p>\n<p>A few other methods for promoting research-backed policies seem promising based on a bit less evidence:</p>\n<p>2c) Increasing awareness of evidence-based policy&#x2014;Sending employees reminders or newsletters seems to increase research-based medicine based on two high-quality review papers (Murthy et al. 2012; Grimshaw et al. 2012). . Similarly, all-around advocacy campaigns to promote evidence-based practices among practitioners achieves substantial changes in one randomized controlled trial (Schneider et al. 2017).</p>\n<p>2d) Access&#x2014;Merely giving people evidence on effectiveness does not generally affect behavior, but when combined with efforts to motivate use of the evidence, providing access to research does improve evidence-based practice (Chinman et al. 2017; Wilson et al. 2017).</p>\n<p>2e) External motivation and professional identities&#x2014; Two recent RCTs and a number of reviews and qualitative research find that rewarding people for using evidence and building professional standards around using research are helpful&#xA0;(Chinman et al. 2017; Schneider et al. 2017;Hodder et al. 2017; Forman-Hoffman et al. 2017; Weiss et al. 2005; Weiss 1995; Wilson et al. 2017; Weiss 1980; Weiss 1977; Matias 2017; Coburn 2005; Coburn 2003).<br><br>3) Interestingly, a few methods to promote evidence-based practices that policymakers and researchers often promote do not have much support in the literature. The first is building collaboration between policymakers and researchers, and the second is creating more research in line with policymakers&apos; needs One of the highest-quality write-ups on evidence-based policy, Langer et al. 2016 finds that collaboration only works if it is deliberately structured to build policymakers&apos; and researchers&apos; skills. When it comes to making research more practical for policymakers, it seems that when policymakers and researchers work together to come up with research that is more relevant to policy, it has little impact. This may be because, as noted in point (1), research seems to influence policy in important but indirect ways, so making it more direct may not help much.<br><br>4) There is surprisingly and disappointingly little research on policymakers&apos; cognition and judgment in general. The best research is familiar to the effective altruism community from Philip Tetlock (1985; 1994; 2005; 2010; 2014; 2016) and Barbara Mellers (2015), and it gives little information on how decision-makers respond to scientific evidence, but suggests that they are not very accurate at making predictions in general. Other research indicates that extremists are particularly prone to overconfidence and oversimplification, and conservatives somewhat more prone to these errors than liberals (Ortoleva and Snowberg 2015; Blomberg and Harrington 2000; Kahan 2017; Tetlock 1984; Tetlock 2000). Otherwise, a little research suggests that policymakers in general are susceptible to the same cognitive biases that affect everyone, particularly loss aversion, which may make policymakers irrationally unwilling to end ineffective programs or start proven but novel ones (Levy 2003; McDermott 2004). On the whole, little psychological research studies how policymakers react to new information.</p>\n<p><br>Overall, this literature offers some broad classes of strategies that have worked in some contexts and that can be refined and selected based on intuition and experience. At the very least, I think those promoting reason and evidence can take heart that research and science do seem to matter, even if it&apos;s hard to see.</p>\n<p><span>Bibliography:&#xA0;</span></p>\n<div>\n<p>Banuri, Sheheryar, Stefan Dercon, and Varun Gauri. &quot;Biased policy professionals.&quot; (2017).</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>Blomberg, S.

EA action is very much individual action. Even when volunteering or giving part of my income, I still see that is primarily individualistic. I believe someone can be an EA without knowing about the EA movement.</p>\n<p>I first met another EA while traveling to NY for secondary testing (altruistic kidney donation). We talked briefly.* That was my first face-to-face encounter with a fellow EA. Last night I attended my first EA event (a meetup in Madison, WI). Think of it, five years later!&#xA0;</p>\n<p>A new friend came along with me. After the meetup, he mentioned how we didn&#x2019;t do anything. (The event was called &#x201C;Lightning Talks.&#x201D;) We just discussed ideas. He had a valid point. It was true.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>I reiterated the <a href=\"/ea/cy/the_impact_you_can_and_cant_make_in_an_hour/\">Lawyer in the Soup Kitchen</a> (mentioned in the beginning of the meetup) about how volunteering time locally is not always the most impactful action. Additionally, I discussed learning about new potential cause areas and how not every EA idea is intuitive. But I had already figured he would bring up &#x201C;action&#x201D; versus &#x201C;philosophy&#x201D; anyway. So I went further into what a pure &#x201C;action&#x201D; or &quot;doing&quot; good meetup could be: I imagine a hardcore EA meetup could be primarily about making money. I mean actually making money during the meetup: contract work.</p>\n<p>By learning a programming language, one can freelance their time&#x2014;anywhere, whenever&#x2014;by taking on, say, an HTML contract or even non-programming related jobs though freelance websites (e.g., UpWork). Wouldn&#x2019;t that be incredible? What if&#xA0;most of the time of most EA events involved learning and doing how to do online freelance jobs? EA concepts and key ideas could be the dressing on the side, sprinkled in when needed. The salad could be all those morsels of contract work floating about online.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://imgur.com/0E0y6Co\" alt=\"\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/0E0y6Co.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>I imagine such a hardcore meetup would involve pooling the income earned to donate to a specific charity, such as SCI. I realize this would turn off a lot of new people to EA. It&apos;s&#xA0;working for free&#x2014;even if the time included learning [C, C++, JS, Java, Ruby, etc.] language. To someone new, I think it may seem cultish and well...detached. Plus, I think there&#x2019;d be a gender disparity. Plus the advocacy part of the meetup, learning how to effectively advocate EA to others, would take a hit.&#xA0;Several potential negatives. It depends on the size of the group.</p>\n<p>My main question for you: <strong>How would you discuss the point from a friend new to EA: &#x201C;Nothing was practically accomplished at the meeting. Ideas were discussed.&#x201D;</strong></p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p>*Side tangent, we are both vegetarian. I mentioned that I went to an all vegan NY restaurant, and she told me about vegan friends who eat beef&#x2014;because beef cattle suffer the least. Whether or not this is true, I bring it up when discussing&#xA0;veg*anism to express how Suffering is my primary reason. It bridges a gap in understanding.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p>Related, but does not mention online freelance/contract work:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/ea/1ow/why_groups_should_consider_direct_work/\">effective-altruism.com/ea/1ow/why_groups_should_consider_direct_work</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/ea/1oc/remote_volunteering_opportunities_in_effective/\">effective-altruism.com/ea/1oc/remote_volunteering_opportunities_in_effective</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"/ea/1i7/introducing_ea_work_club_highimpact_jobs_and_side/\">eawork.club</a></p></body></html>", "user": {"username": "adamaero"}}, {"_id": "89B9tQzfJB4wLKyvF", "title": "HLAI 2018 Field Report", "postedAt": "2018-08-29T00:13:22.489Z", "htmlBody": "<html><body><p><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/axsizR4vEX8qtuLpR/hlai-2018-field-report\"><em>Cross-posted from LW</em></a></p>\n<p><span>I spent the past week in Prague (natively called Praha, but known widely as Prague via the usual mechanisms others decide your own names) at the </span><a href=\"https://www.hlai-conf.org/\"><span>Human Level AI multi-conference</span></a><span> held between the AGI, BICA, the NeSY conferences.

If you didn&apos;t already know, </span><a href=\"/ea/1ls/introducing_czech_association_for_effective/\"><span>Prague is rapidly becoming a hub for effective altruists in Europe</span></a><span>, and having visited it&apos;s easy to see why: the city is beautiful, most people speak enough English that communication is easy for everyone, the food is delicious (there&apos;s lots of vegan food even though traditional Czech cuisine is literally meat and potatoes), and it&apos;s easily accessible to everyone on the continent. Some of the recent events held in Prague include the </span><a href=\"http://humanaligned.ai/\"><span>Human-aligned AI Summer School</span></a><span> and the upcoming Prague </span><a href=\"https://aisafetycamp.com/\"><span>AI safety camp</span></a><span>.</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>Wednesday was the first day of the conference, and I honestly wasn&apos;t quite sure what to expect, but </span><a href=\"http://goertzel.org/\"><span>Ben Goertzel</span></a><span> did a great job of setting the tone with his introductory keynote that made clear the focus was on exploring ideas related to building AGI. We then dove in to talk after talk for the next 4 days, each one considering an idea that might lie on the path to enabling general intelligence for machines, and we doubled-up on the third day with a Future of AI program that considered AI policy and ethics issues. I took a lot of notes, but being a safety researcher I&apos;m hesitant to share them because that feels like a hazard that might accelerate AGI development, so instead I&apos;ll share a few high-level insights that I think summarize what I learned without saying anything with more than a very small (let&apos;s say &lt; 5%) chance of giving someone a dangerous inspiration they wouldn&apos;t have had anyway or as soon.</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Progress towards AGI is not amorphous; it&apos;s being made through small starts by individuals with faces and names. I knew this intellectually, but it was different to live it&#x2014;shaking people&apos;s hands, swapping stories, and hearing them express their hopes and doubts that don&apos;t appear in published work because it doesn&apos;t fit the academic form. That said, I still find their work threatening, but now I know the threat on a human level.</li>\n<li>Thankfully we are further away than it often feels like if you focus on the success of deep learning systems. Nearly everyone at the conference agreed that deep learning in its current form is missing some key ingredients to get to AGI. Again, I won&apos;t repeat here what those are, but the good news is that deep learning appears to not be on the path to AGI even if it can produce non-general superintelligence, and AGI requires new paradigms in machine intelligence that we either haven&apos;t discovered or don&apos;t yet know how to make work well in practice.</li>\n<li>From talking to people I have a stronger model of why they work on capabilities and not safety or, as is more often the case, think safety concerns do not require extreme caution, instead necessitating only normal levels of caution as is the case in most engineering disciplines. My read from dozens of similar interactions with researchers is that this attitude reflects both a lack of deep reflection on safety and a difficulty in updating to an idea that would break the momentum of their life&apos;s work.</li>\n<li>But not everyone was like this. For example, once people figured out I was a &quot;safety guy&quot;, one person came up to me and asked what he should do because he has an idea he thinks would move AI in a dangerous direction and didn&apos;t know if he should publish anyway, keep it a secret, or do something else. I recommended that he reach out to MIRI, and I hope he will, but it exposed to me that even when a capabilities researcher notices their work is going in a dangerous direction they don&apos;t have a standard script for what to do about it.</li>\n<li>On a different note, EA continues to have perception problems. I talked to two people who said things that indicated they lean EA, asked them about if they identified that way, and then they told me they didn&apos;t because they associate EA with Singer-style act utilitarianism and self-imposed poverty through maximizing donated income. I let them know the EA tent is much bigger than that, but clearly EA evangelists have more work to do in this direction.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>To summarize, I think the main takeaway is that we, being the sorts of persons who read LessWrong, live in a bubble where we know AGI is dangerous, and outside that bubble people still don&apos;t know or have confused ideas about how it&apos;s dangerous, even among the group of people weird enough to work on AGI instead of more academically respectable, narrow AI. That&apos;s really scary, because the people outside the bubble also include those affecting public policy and making business decisions, and they lack the perspective we share about the dangers of both narrow and general AI. Luckily, this points towards two opportunities we can work on now to mitigate the risks of AGI:</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Normalize thinking about AI safety</strong><span>. Right now it would be a major improvement if we could move the field of AI research to be on par with the way biomedical researchers think about risks for near-term, narrow applications of their research, let alone getting everyone thinking about the existential risks of AGI. I think most of this work needs to happen on a 1-to-1, human level right now, pushing individual researchers towards more safety-focus and reshaping the culture of the AI research community. For this reason I think it&apos;s extremely important that I and others make an effort to</span></li>\n<ol>\n<li>attend AI capabilities conferences,</li>\n<li>form personal relationships with AI researchers,</li>\n<li>and encourage them to take safety seriously.</li>\n</ol>\n<li><strong>Establish and publicize a &quot;sink&quot; for dangerous AI research</strong><span>. When people have an idea they think is dangerous (which assumes to some extent we succeed at the previous objective, but as I mentioned it already comes up now), they need a default script for what to do. Cybersecurity and biomedical research have standard approaches, and although I don&apos;t think their approaches will work the same for AGI, we can use them as models for designing a standard. The sink source should then be owned by a team seen as extremely responsible, reliable, and committed to safety above all else. I recommend FHI or MIRI (or both!) take on that role. The sub-actions of this work are to</span></li>\n<ol>\n<li>design and establish a process,</li>\n<li>find it a home,</li>\n<li>publicize its use,</li>\n<li>and continually demonstrate its effectiveness&#x2014;especially to capabilities researchers who might have dangerous ideas&#x2014;so it remains salient.</li>\n</ol>\n</ol>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>These interventions are more than I can take on myself, and I don&apos;t believe I have a comparative advantage to execute on them, so I need your help if you&apos;re interested, i.e. if you&apos;ve been thinking about doing more with AI safety, know that there is concrete work you can do now other than technical work on alignment. For myself I&apos;ve set an intention that when I attend HLAI 2020 we&apos;ll have moved at least half-way towards achieving these goals, so I&apos;ll be working on them as best I can, but we&apos;re not going to get there if I have to do it alone.

Yet there are a lot of ways the world is getting gradually better. Not hearing about those is likely to give us a skewed view of the world, and prevent us realising we should learn about what caused those improvements. I also find it easier to stay motivated when I think about the fact that people around the world are getting better off, and how that&#x2019;s often down to the hard work of others. For example, it&#x2019;s not news when another month goes by without a case of guinea worm in South Sudan. So we only hear about guinea worm when there is a new case. But in fact,&#xA0;<a href=\"https://reliefweb.int/report/chad/announcement-2017-guinea-worm-disease-case-totals\">in 2017, there were only 20 villages with cases of Guinea worm disease in two countries, both in Africa, compared to 23,735 villages in 21 countries on two continents in 1991</a>. That&#x2019;s a really incredible feat for humanity to have pulled off. I&#x2019;d love for there to be more content on the overall positive trends in the world and what&#x2019;s causing them. That could give me a more accurate and more inspiring picture of the world than the news provides. So I thought I&#x2019;d have a go at writing the kind of thing I have in mind. The post was inspired by Zach Groff suggesting we share good news.</p>\n<p>Tragically, another Ebola outbreak has begun in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. That has overshadowed the fact that the WHO has declared the April Ebola outbreak <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/24/health/ebola-congo-who.html\">successfully extinguished</a>. The end of any Ebola outbreak is excellent news: the disease has an average death toll of 50%, and in some cases as high as 90%. In this case there were over 50 infected, of whom 33 died. That is actually a much smaller number than some predicted. The reason for high predicted death tolls is that the outbreak spread to a large city (Mbandaka). That&#x2019;s in contrast with other outbreaks in DRC which have been in very isolated areas, and therefore burned themselves out comparatively swiftly. In addition to the danger of such a disease in a dense urban area, the Mbandaka is a port on the river Congo with strong transport links with the capital, Kinshasa. This proximity to such large populations means that the 2014-2016 West African outbreak is very much on people&#x2019;s minds, which killed over 11,000. But in this case, the outbreak was contained mercifully swiftly.</p>\n<p>It&#x2019;s impossible to know how the outbreak would have progressed had it been treated differently, and which parts of the response to the outbreak had most and least effect. But it is clear that the response to the outbreak was swift and impressive, and it&#x2019;s likely that had a major effect on limiting the death toll. Unlike the 2014 epidemic, Ebola was diagnosed fairly quickly and a state of emergency was called early, with the WHO sending some of its most experienced personnel into the field. This response seems to show how much the international community has learned from the West African outbreak.</p>\n<p>A key intervention employed to curb this outbreak was ring vaccinations. This is the first Ebola outbreak for which a vaccination has been immediately available. It was tested using a randomised controlled trial in West Africa in 2016. Although that epidemic was contained too early for the trial to be completed, the results of the trial seemed promising. In considering this scientific achievement, we should consider not just that we have found a vaccine that works against the world&#x2019;s deadliest disease, but also the important strides we&#x2019;ve made that allow its use. Most obviously impressive is the fact that we are able to administer the vaccine successfully in areas with hot climates and which are difficult to reach despite it needing to be stored and transported at temperatures less than -60 degrees C. The vaccine was also strategically administered, using &#x2018;ring vaccination&#x2019; &#x2013; the same method as was used to successfully eradicate smallpox. That involves, for each case of Ebola, finding all the people that person has been in contact with and vaccinating them, and then doing the same for each of the people those contacts have been in contact with. Tracking all those people down is no mean feat, particularly given the historic difficulty of producing accurate maps. <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2018/05/most-maps-of-the-new-ebola-outbreak-are-wrong/560777/\">Strides in cartography</a> are starting to improve this situation: satellite imagery can be used to mark the positions of buildings, rivers and roads, and then people on the ground can use smartphones or GPS receivers to label the map accurately.</p>\n<p>Our responses to Ebola take advantage of many other improvements in our understanding of diseases and ways of fighting them. That includes things we might think of as simple but are extremely important, like effective disinfectants. It includes using the latest technology to <a href=\"https://health.howstuffworks.com/diseases-conditions/infectious/ebola.htm\">build health bots</a> which search the web for mentions of Ebola, meaning that potential outbreaks can be discovered fast, even if there is a delay in official announcements. And it includes <a href=\"https://www.scidev.net/global/cooperation/feature/anthropologists-medics-ebola-guinea.html\">using anthropology</a> to allow people from one side of the world to understand those on the other well enough to make themselves useful at times when everyone needs to come together.</p>\n<p>Just one family of children being prevented from growing up without a parent, or just one mother being spared the grief of losing a child, is a truly wonderful thing. It&#x2019;s hard to know exactly how significant the tools I&#x2019;ve described were in halting the spread of Ebola. But it&#x2019;s genuinely possible that the response mounted to this outbreak avoided such pain for thousands of families. That&#x2019;s an absolutely incredible feat.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p></body></html>", "user": {"username": "Michelle_Hutchinson"}}, {"_id": "jR2LKoXoL4Aq9T2MQ", "title": "How to make an impact in animal advocacy, a survey.", "postedAt": "2018-08-27T00:42:20.437Z", "htmlBody": "<p><span>Charity Entrepreneurship conducted a survey of 30 leaders and researchers in the <span>animal advocacy</span> movement to try to get a sense of what cause areas have been working well, and, more specifically, what areas might be most promising for founding new organizations. The individuals were selected by speaking to EA-involved animal advocacy activists and by then working outwards based on their recommendations of who to speak to.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span>Interviews lasted between 30 and 120 minutes and most experts were asked fairly similar questions. The two numbers beside each intervention are average rating and weighted weighting. Average rating is just a straightforward average of what each leader thought: a score of 1 was considered low promisingness, 2 mid-promisingness, 3 high promisingness, and 4 highest promisingness. The weighted results depend on how many years of </span><span>animal advocacy</span><span> experience someone had, how utilitarian/EA their mindset was, and their depth of knowledge in comparing different, broad topics. For example, someone who knew a lot, but only about one area, would get a lower weighting than someone who had deep knowledge of several areas. The range in views represents how controversial an issue was among leaders.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span><img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1667995785/mirroredImages/jR2LKoXoL4Aq9T2MQ/xdq0xytq2ttj17inwuue.png\"></span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span>These are the results I am most confident in, as I was able to ask almost all interviewees about most broad areas. For the more detailed sub-areas, I was not able to ask about all 100+ interventions. I was only able to ask \u201cin the broad area of Events, what might be the best/worst things\u201d, and update the interventions in that area based on the person's response. For example, if someone gave Events an overall score of 2 (mid promisingness), but mentioned one intervention they felt was less promising and one intervention they thought was more promising, those two scores would be adjusted (e.g. respectively to a 1 and 3), but the other unmentioned interventions would be given the ranking they have in the broad area (in this case a 2). This could lead to ideas that are less well-known receiving ratings closer to the area-average due to people mentioning it less. </span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16mTgxnk4rZtdE_xgYQ-MxFY1grxXkma1BA0wI_cV3Bg/edit#gid=0\"><span>Full results spreadsheet for all areas</span></a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span>The safest way, therefore, to interpret data on individual interventions is to limit it to comparisons within a &nbsp;sub-area.

I do think some judgements can also be made across areas, although they should be made with lower confidence. &nbsp;</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span>Additional Details</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span>The numbers tell us a lot, but it's hard to get everything across with them.

Some people thought that now was the time to start planning for the next campaigns to be conducted (e.g. on fish). Others thought it would be better to continue focusing on the current egg/chicken campaigns to guarantee follow through and expansion to international level. There was some concern that this cause area was fairly full, with strong organizations already working on it, while others argued that very high impact gaps were yet to be filled.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span>Research</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span><img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1667995785/mirroredImages/jR2LKoXoL4Aq9T2MQ/ih6t1qxwi7trc9flfu2b.png\"></span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span>Research, although it had a high average, was more divisive, with many people thinking it was the most important thing to work on, while others believed that research did not generally affect </span><span>animal advocacy</span><span> organizations and activist actions. Opinions differed on what research is highest impact: movement building, fundamental crucial considerations, and practical interventions each had strong supporters. People mentioned ensuring that research has a clear path to making an impact, as it seems easy to get lost in abstraction. Many people were concerned that, even if research was well conducted, it would not influence organizations </span><span>unless </span><span>it first influenced funders who then influenced organizations via their granting choices.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span>Product Creation</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1667995785/mirroredImages/jR2LKoXoL4Aq9T2MQ/ikoxlqztvpgjusotco0l.png\"></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span>Akin to research, the average score ended up being high with a lot of mixed views thrown in. Many people saw it as the most promising area, with the potential to shock the whole industry. However, expected timelines and market share estimates varied widely between experts, leading to very different optimism/pessimism levels. Opinions were also fairly split on whether plant based or clean meat was the more promising sub-area. People seemed to agree, however, that overall the area has lots of funding and talent pouring in and, hence, is less neglected. Some argued that the right amount of attention had been paid to the area already, while others suggested that too many activists were joining the cause and that non-activist, pay-motivated actors would probably jump on the opportunity if there appeared a promising one. </span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span>Political Outreach </span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span><img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1667995785/mirroredImages/jR2LKoXoL4Aq9T2MQ/d7jdrfz4ksrj89w9omvd.png\"></span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span>The consensus was that this is an area with a lot of gaps and neglect. Some thought this was due to pragmatic concerns. For example, it will always be hard to compete with high budget animal agriculture lobbies. Others thought it was more due to the momentum of the movement and the lack of expertise of current </span><span>animal advocacy</span><span> activists. Views on how to act were mixed but generally people thought that focusing on the small scale (e.g. state or city) and on countries other than the US might be more promising. At the very least, there is room for research to identify the most promising interventions in this area, as it currently proves to be a very low information space. </span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span>Welfare Condition Improvements</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span><img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1667995785/mirroredImages/jR2LKoXoL4Aq9T2MQ/oe2a5xhovp4wqthk8mbe.png\"></span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span>Somewhat like political outreach, this was a lower information space. People thought some work could be done, particularly when paired with other interventions. For example, inventing a better process for stunning fish and then lobbying companies to apply it. Some of the more far-fetched ideas seemed promising to people </span><span>initially</span><span>, although few people were well-informed enough to have strong views on, for instance, GMO animals. Most people were fairly neutral and unsure about this class of interventions.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span>Wild Animal Suffering</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span><img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1667995785/mirroredImages/jR2LKoXoL4Aq9T2MQ/fanwrapnndqg5jlgcqj2.png\"></span></p>\n<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span>Wild animal suffering was the most controversial issue on this list, with many people suggesting that although it was an important consideration, it was just too early for serious work on the issue. Others pointed out the very high numbers of individuals affected vs the very low number of people currently in the area. Almost everyone agreed that research had to be conducted and interventions, if applied, had to be very carefully executed. Nearly everyone seemed to be against interventions that would come into major conflict with different value systems. Generally, the people who thought this cause was promising believed also that much more research needed to be done before interventions could be effectively applied.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span>A related issue that people were generally more positive about was intervening on behalf of insects (e.g. lobbying against silk or for humane insecticide). Nevertheless, concerns about it being too early to focus on such issues were also prevalent.</span><strong><br><br></strong></p>\n<p><span>Improving Existing NGOs</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span><img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1667995785/mirroredImages/jR2LKoXoL4Aq9T2MQ/lfdzdb8sqatps2kfm7c0.png\"></span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span>Views varied about the opportunities in this area. Coordination and talent gap improvement were mentioned by a lot of people, with marketing, applied research, and diversity being mentioned by some. Overall, even the people who thought this area had promise had major concerns about its tractability. One activist worded it as follows: \u201cMany of the leaders in </span><span>animal advocacy</span><span> where promoted due to dedication to their ideals and stubbornness; those are hard minds to change\u201d. Others found the idea great in principle, while remaining unsure on how to realise it. The one large exception that many people were excited about was the possibility of increasing the talent pool in the animal <span>advocacy </span>movement on the whole, particularly in countries like India and China, who currently have a less established movement. Generally, this area seemed tricky to do well, but if the talent gap problem could be reduced it could be of very high impact. Working on teaching animal activists to be more effective and then pairing them with organizations in need could be one possible approach. </span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span>Events</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span><img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1667995785/mirroredImages/jR2LKoXoL4Aq9T2MQ/bjojmex8mmfl3mbomcdv.png\"></span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span>Events were generally seen as mildly positive but low on cost-effectiveness. Many people thought there was room for more and/or improved conferences. Some mentioned events which focused on retention. Event categories like protests raised many people\u2019s concerns over being net negative, while others thought protests were promising but neglected. </span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span>Individual Vegan Outreach</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;<img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1667995785/mirroredImages/jR2LKoXoL4Aq9T2MQ/aprhmkiuszyun377owmi.png\"></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span>At the bottom of the rankings was vegan outreach. It was once seen as the most promising way forward, but many people have obtained quite negative views on it now. Generally, people thought just the right amount or too many resources were being invested into this area. Many people were more positive about long form and in-depth media (e.g. documentaries and humane education) than they were about short form outreach (e.g. flyers and online ads). People thought focusing on countries outside of the EU and the US could be somewhat promising, given that these markets are generally less saturated.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span>Other</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span><img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1667995785/mirroredImages/jR2LKoXoL4Aq9T2MQ/gxe9ct3ukj9ega3bpopx.png\"></span></p>\n<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span>Sadly, I was not able to get enough people\u2019s views on the interventions that fell outside of these broad categories and thus, it\u2019s ranked at an average score of middle effectiveness.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span>Conclusion</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span>Although there are lots of different views in the animal <span>advocacy</span> movement, there are some shared views across many in the movement.

Answering this question is highly important if you are trying to reduce existential risk. Understanding people\u2019s thoughts on existential risk may help explain why the issue has been neglected and suggest ways to change this. It is crucial for movement building and considering how to approach the issue with key decision makers.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span>Some studies have been conducted to address the question of what people think about existential risk, but the results have been inconclusive. In 2017, Spencer Greenberg conducted several studies using Amazon Mechanical Turk and obtained median estimates for the likelihood of human extinction in the next 50 years ranging from .00001% to 1%, with means ranging from 11% to 18%. The percentage of people who estimated a 50% or greater likelihood of extinction within 50 years also ranged from 11% to 18%. Randle and Eckersly (2015) surveyed 2073 people across the US, UK, Canada, and Australia in 2013 and found that 24% rated the likelihood of human extinction in the next 100 years as greater than or equal to 50%.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span>Getting reliable answers for this type of question is notoriously difficult. The wording of the questions has differed across studies, potentially affecting the result. However, the results may vary even when the wording is held constant: Greenberg\u2019s median estimates of 1% and .00001% were both obtained from samples of over 200 people on Mechanical Turk, and the wording of the question was the same in each case. You can view a comparison of the wording and results across his studies </span><a href=\"http://bit.ly/2xyOxNt%EF%BB%BF\"><span>here</span></a><span>. The way questions are presented adds another level of variability to the answers. Greenberg provided participants with a list of options, and six of the eighteen options were less than 1%. In the study by Randle and Eckersly (2015), on the other hand, 1% was the lowest option available. What\u2019s more, they provided verbal descriptions with the odds, including \u201cNo chance, almost no chance\u201d for 1 in 100 and \u201cSlight possibility\u201d for 2 in 10 (!). In the current study, participants were asked to type in a percentage, rather than being given options to choose from. </span></p>\n<p><span>I hypothesized that the variability in results might be due to people not having strong opinions on the subject and being uncertain about their answers, so I asked people to indicate how confident they were in each of their answers. I also wanted to test whether phrasing the question in terms of going extinct (as Greenberg did) or being wiped out (as Randle and Eckersley did) would affect the responses. Finally, I wanted to start exploring how much of a priority people think preventing human extinction should be for government and whether that answer is correlated with their estimate of extinction risk.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span>The aims of the study were to:</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><span>Replicate the results of previous studies on public perception of how likely it is that humanity will go extinct in the near future and broaden the range of time scales asked about</span></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><span>Begin to explore how confident people are of these beliefs</span></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><span>Check whether wording the question as \u201cgo extinct\u201d versus \u201cbe wiped out\u201d affects people\u2019s estimates </span></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><span>Gauge public opinion on the government\u2019s role in preventing human extinction</span></p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong><br><br></strong></p>\n<p><span>Methods </span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span>The survey was administered via Positly, drawing from Mechanical Turk workers in the USA.

The 0 of the slider was labeled \u201cThe government does not devote any resources to preventing human extinction\u201d and the 10 end was labeled \u201cPreventing human extinction is the government's number one priority\u201d (or \u201cshould not\u201d instead of \u201cdoes not\u201d and \u201cshould be\u201d instead of \u201cis\u201d). </span><span>No explicit instructions were provided about how to interpret the scale. This rather vague format was chosen to abstract away from particular issues (e.g. whether it be prioritized more or less than education). The particular score on the ten-point scale does not mean much by itself and cannot tell us about support or opposition for particular policies or budget decisions, but the idea was to get at people\u2019s perception of how much the government prioritizes the issue versus how much it should.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div>\n<table><colgroup><col><col><col><col></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>Does</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>Should</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><span>Median</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>2.5</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>6.2</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><span>Mean</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>3.1</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>5.8</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><span>Mode</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>0 (52 out of 395, but note that 9 said 10)</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>10 (36 out of 395, but note that 20 said 0)</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><span>There were weak correlations between participants\u2019 estimates of the likelihood of extinction over each time frame and how much of a priority they said preventing human extinction should be for the government (r = .19, .18, and .18 for 50, 100, and 500 years respectively; p &lt; .001 for all three).</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span>Participant Comments</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span>Positly asks participants for feedback after they complete the survey.

It is worth pointing out the difference in format once again: Greenberg had participants choose from a list of options, whereas I asked them to type in a number. Few people gave answers between zero one percent (5%, 4%, and 3% of people did so for the 50, 100, and 500 year questions, respectively). Many more people said there was a 0% chance of extinction over the specified time range (34%, 20%, and 7% for the 50, 100, and 500 year questions, respectively). The responses of 0% might represent a belief that there is no way we will go extinct in the specified time range, but it is likely that many of them are because of people rounding their answer to the nearest whole percent--1% was also a popular choice (19%, 12%, and 9% of respondents for the 50, 100, and 500 year questions, respectively).</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span>The proportion of people who put the chance of extinction in 50 or 100 years at greater than or equal to 50% was smaller than in Greenberg\u2019s or Randle and Eckersley\u2019s studies (6% versus 11 to 18% for 50 years, and 13% versus 24% for 500 years). Nonetheless, it is worth noting the wide spread of the responses and the tail of people assigning large probabilities to the human extinction in the near future.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><span>Begin to explore how confident people are of these beliefs</span></p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span>People were more confident about their 50 year estimates than their 100 or 500 year estimates, as we would expect. </span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span>I also expected that people\u2019s confidence in their answers would be quite low, since I had conducted a few interviews in which I asked about the likelihood of human extinction in the next 100 years, and the interviewees typically expressed a great deal of uncertainty about their estimates.</span><span> Contrary to my expectations, however, the survey respondents did not generally report great uncertainty about their answers, and many people reported complete confidence in their predictions. This is some evidence against my explanation that the variability in survey results might be due to people having no idea of the answer and just picking something out of the air. However, the large number of people who, without prompting, wrote in the comment section that they had rarely or never thought about the topic suggests that we should not discount that explanation too strongly. </span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span>Methodological issues may account for the finding--a slider with such precision may not have been an intuitive or informative way to ask about confidence/certainty, etc. More sophisticated ways of asking about confidence and/or testing how the beliefs change when presented with new evidence, could produce more conclusive evidence on the strength of these beliefs.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><span>Check whether wording the question as \u201cgo extinct\u201d versus \u201cbe wiped out\u201d affects people\u2019s estimates &nbsp;</span></p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span>No, this wording did not make a difference.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><span>Gauge public opinion on the government\u2019s role in preventing human extinction</span></p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span>On the whole, people expressed that the government should prioritize preventing human extinction more than it currently does. Participants\u2019 estimates of the likelihood of extinction were correlated with how much of a priority they think it should be for the government, but only weakly.</span><strong><br><br></strong></p>\n<p><span>More research would be needed to determine what policies people would support and how they would rate preventing human extinction relative to other priorities. Future research could also attempt to disentangle the issues of budget and priority, which were confounded in this study because the lower end of the scale mentioned \u201cresources\u201d and the upper end said \u201cprioritize\u201d. People might think that it should be a strategic priority but should not be given a large share of the budget; this came up in the interviews I mentioned above.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span>It is worth bringing up the comments section again: many people said the topic of the survey was thought-provoking, unusual, and/or something they don\u2019t tend to think about. Combining these comments with the finding that people think the government should be doing more to prevent human extinction suggests that the issue might be neglected ont because people think it\u2019s unimportant but because they just don\u2019t tend to think about it at all, or at least not seriously. </span></p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><strong><span>References</span></strong></p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><span>Buhrmester M, Kwang T, Gosling SD.

The website was created and is maintained by <a href=\"/user/vipulnaik/\">Vipul Naik</a>, with <a href=\"https://contractwork.vipulnaik.com/venue.php?venue=Donations+list+website\">contributions</a> from me (Issa Rice).</p>\n<p>The aim of this post is to introduce DLW to the world and gather some feedback. DLW has been in active development since <a href=\"https://github.com/vipulnaik/donations/commit/34ab85f9336c48231f0ec0258f7556df953fdb81\">January 2017</a>, and is planned for launch by the end of December 2019. At the moment DLW is in a pre-release state, where Vipul and I are adding both data and features to the site.</p>\n<p>The first half of this post gives a tutorial of DLW, focusing especially on the features of the site that are not obvious to casual inspection. The second half of this post is a request for feedback; Vipul and I are interested in using the feedback to help us decide where to focus our efforts for future development.</p>\n<h2>Tutorial</h2>\n<p>This section is a tutorial of the main features of Donations List Website (DLW), with a focus on the parts that are probably non-obvious to casual users.</p>\n<h3>Main page</h3>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://donations.vipulnaik.com\">main page</a> of DLW shows information aggregated from all donations tracked by the site. The main page has the path starting with <code>/</code> or <code>/index.php</code>.</p>\n<p>The main page of DLW has an optional parameter called <code>display</code> that changes the kind and number of donations listed. Currently, the possible values are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://donations.vipulnaik.com/?display=individual-scale\"><code>individual-scale</code></a>, which displays donations made by individuals (in other words, excluding donations made by private foundations and other group entities)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://donations.vipulnaik.com/?display=full\"><code>full</code></a>, which displays all donations tracked by DLW</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://donations.vipulnaik.com/\">empty value</a> (the default), which restricts donations to the top 30 donors, donees, and cause areas</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Donor page</h3>\n<p>Each donor tracked by DLW has a donor page. Donor pages have a path starting with <code>/donor.php</code>. An example is the <a href=\"https://donations.vipulnaik.com/donor.php?donor=Open+Philanthropy+Project\">donor page for the Open Philanthropy Project</a>.</p>\n<p>For the Open Philanthropy Project in particular, there is a <a href=\"https://donations.vipulnaik.com/donor.php?donor=Open+Philanthropy+Project#donorDonationAmountsByDisclosuresAndYear\">table of disclosures</a> (from before it stopped announcing disclosures). Currently no other donor has disclosures data.</p>\n<h3>Donee page</h3>\n<p>Each donee tracked by DLW has a donee page. Donee pages have a path starting with <code>/donee.php</code>. An example is the <a href=\"https://donations.vipulnaik.com/donee.php?donee=LessWrong+2.0\">donee page for LessWrong 2.0</a>.</p>\n<p>Some entities are both a donor and a donee, in which case there will be separate pages for each role. An example is the Berkeley Existential Risk Initiative (BERI):</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://donations.vipulnaik.com/donor.php?donor=Berkeley+Existential+Risk+Initiative\">BERI as a donor</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://donations.vipulnaik.com/donee.php?donee=Berkeley+Existential+Risk+Initiative\">BERI as a donee</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Donor&#x2013;donee page</h3>\n<p>It is sometimes interesting to look at a specific donor&#x2013;donee pair and see all the donations made by the donor to the donee, their relationship, a list of documents that mention both of them, and so on. For this, DLW has a donor&#x2013;donee page for each such pair. Donor&#x2013;donee pages have a path starting with <code>/donorDonee.php</code>. An example of this is the page for <a href=\"https://donations.vipulnaik.com/donorDonee.php?donor=Open+Philanthropy+Project&amp;donee=Machine+Intelligence+Research+Institute\">Open Philanthropy Project donations made to the Machine Intelligence Research Institute</a>.</p>\n<h3>Influencer page</h3>\n<p>The influencer page looks at the amount of money influenced (a.k.a. the &#x201C;<a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/about/impact#MoneyMovedDefinition\">money moved</a>&#x201D;) by an entity. This is tracked separately from donations, so it is possible to compare the amount of money moved that is <em>claimed</em> (gathered from the entity claiming money moved, e.g.&#xA0;GiveWell) with the amount of money moved that is <em>actually accounted for</em> (gathered from the entities making or receiving the donations, e.g.&#xA0;Against Malaria Foundation or individual donors). Influencer pages have a path starting with <code>/influencer.php</code>.</p>\n<p>The only entity for which we currently track money moved information is GiveWell. You can see the amount of influence claimed vs amount of money accounted for in the <a href=\"https://donations.vipulnaik.com/influencer.php?influencer=GiveWell#influencerMoneyMovedList\">money moved table</a>.</p>\n<p>Even for non-GiveWell entities, influencer pages exist. An example is <a href=\"https://donations.vipulnaik.com/influencer.php?influencer=Chloe+Cockburn\">Chloe Cockburn</a>. In these cases, there is no comparison between the &#x201C;money moved claimed&#x201D; and &#x201C;money moved accounted for&#x201D;, because we have not entered any data for the &#x201C;money moved claimed&#x201D;. However, it is still possible to see a list of all donations that were influenced.</p>\n<h3>Cause area filter</h3>\n<p>Most pages on DLW accept an optional cause area parameter called <code>cause_area_filter</code>. Using this parameter filters the donations to show only those with a matching cause area.</p>\n<p>To give some examples:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://donations.vipulnaik.com/donor.php?donor=Open+Philanthropy+Project&amp;cause_area_filter=AI+safety\">Open Philanthropy Project&#x2019;s AI safety donations</a> (note the <code>cause_area_filter=AI+safety</code> in the URL)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://donations.vipulnaik.com/?cause_area_filter=AI+safety\">AI safety donations in general</a> (note the <code>cause_area_filter=AI+safety</code> in the URL)</li>\n<li>Since the cause areas used on DLW track sub-cause areas as well, it is possible to use it a little like a search feature. For example, using <a href=\"https://donations.vipulnaik.com/donor.php?donor=Open+Philanthropy+Project&amp;cause_area_filter=chicken\"><code>cause_area_filter=chicken</code> on Open Philanthropy Project donations</a> shows all donations that have the string &#x201C;chicken&#x201D; somewhere in the cause area.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://donations.vipulnaik.com/influencer.php?influencer=Chloe+Cockburn&amp;cause_area_filter=bail+reform\">Chloe Cockburn donations influenced with sub-cause area matching &#x201C;bail reform&#x201D;</a> (for influencer pages, currently the filtering only works on some of the tables)</li>\n<li>The cause area filter supports <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression\">regular expressions</a>, so for example you can search for <a href=\"https://donations.vipulnaik.com/donor.php?donor=Open+Philanthropy+Project&amp;cause_area_filter=AI+safety%7Cchicken\">all Open Philanthropy Project donations with cause area containing &#x201C;AI safety&#x201D; or &#x201C;chicken&#x201D;</a>. (This example is a bit silly and I&#x2019;m not aware of a better example.)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Donee pages don&#x2019;t have this option, because most donees only work within a single cause area.</p>\n<h3>About page</h3>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://donations.vipulnaik.com/about/\">about page</a> discusses how DLW is built and reliability concerns for the data.</p>\n<h2>Request for feedback</h2>\n<p>This section is an official request for feedback from readers of this forum. Vipul and I want to make Donations List Website (DLW) as useful as possible to people who think about effective giving, flow of money in the non-profit world, real-world decision making, and similar topics. To help us decide what improvements to prioritize, we would like to hear from you what excites you most about DLW, what you could see yourself using it for, what improvements would make you use it more, and so on.</p>\n<p>Below, we provide some structure for feedback. We would appreciate feedback as (1) comments on this post, or (2) submissions to <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfWp8OZV8lT36jn9r6UwcXr1vq7ON4LkIHE5s4wHEP6vOruwg/viewform?usp=sf_link\">this Google Form</a>. The differences between the two are that the Google Form has fields for each question (more structure), can be submitted anonymously, and individual responses will not be shared publicly.</p>\n<h3>Did you already know about DLW? Do you use it for anything?</h3>\n<p>To start off, we are curious to get a feel for whether people have already discovered DLW on their own and whether they use it for anything.</p>\n<p>As an example response, I will talk a little about my own experience using DLW. I&#x2019;ve found it useful for the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Since October 2017, I have been working on a website called <a href=\"https://aiwatch.issarice.com/\">AI Watch</a> that tracks activity in the world of AI safety. More recently, I&#x2019;ve expanded the scope of AI Watch to cause areas outside AI safety, resulting in <a href=\"https://orgwatch.issarice.com/\">Org Watch</a>. Having access to data from DLW has helped me find names of people involved in various cause areas, which has made data collection faster for my work on these other websites.</li>\n<li>I had been curious about the donations of certain individuals (examples: <a href=\"https://donations.vipulnaik.com/donor.php?donor=Vitalik+Buterin\">Vitalik Buterin</a> and <a href=\"https://donations.vipulnaik.com/donor.php?donor=Gwern+Branwen\">gwern</a>) but as far as I could tell, there was no canonical location listing donations made by them. DLW has solved this problem for me for these individuals.</li>\n<li>One day, I suddenly became curious about the indirect flow of money from the Open Philanthropy Project (Open Phil) to the Machine Intelligence Research Institute (MIRI). By &#x201C;indirect flow of money&#x201D; I mean not grants that Open Phil has made to MIRI, but where Open Phil grants money to some intermediate entity, who then donates to MIRI. Having access to both the DLW and Org Watch datasets meant I could do some exploration by looking at (1) organizations that had received money from Open Phil, that had also donated to MIRI, and (2) individuals who worked for organizations that received funding from Open Phil, who were also individual MIRI donors.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Potential improvements &#x2013; what are your thoughts?</h3>\n<p>This subsection lists some potential improvements we&#x2019;ve thought of.</p>\n<h4>Add more foundation giving data</h4>\n<p>Currently, DLW tracks the giving data of foundations including the Gates Foundation, Arnold Foundation, Hewlett Foundation, Good Ventures/Open Philanthropy Project, and Ford Foundation. However, there are many more foundations whose donations we could track.</p>\n<h4>Add more individual giving data</h4>\n<p>Similar to the above, there are many individuals whose donations we could track.</p>\n<h4>Add more data about things related to the effective altruism or rationality communities</h4>\n<p>DLW already has an emphasis on these communities, but there&#x2019;s still more that can be added.</p>\n<h4>Add more money moved data</h4>\n<p>Currently we have only entered claimed money moved data for GiveWell. However there are some other entities that publish money moved data, like <a href=\"https://animalcharityevaluators.org/about/impact/giving-metrics/\">Animal Charity Evaluators</a>.</p>\n<h4>Systematically track considerations that donors make</h4>\n<p>Donors concerned with effective giving have many considerations as they think through their decision. These include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Giving now vs later</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://blog.givewell.org/2014/12/02/donor-coordination-and-the-givers-dilemma/\">Donor coordination and giver&#x2019;s dilemma</a></li>\n<li>Donating to a single charity vs multiple charities</li>\n<li>How to weigh local knowledge vs analyses published by others</li>\n<li>How much weight to place on cost-effectiveness calculations vs less quantitative forms of modeling and reasoning</li>\n<li>Whether to use a donor-advised fund</li>\n<li>Size of average donation (relative to total wealth)</li>\n<li>Which population ethics to use</li>\n<li>Which worldviews to use, and what entities to see as &#x201C;equal&#x201D; (all animals? all humans? all people with a certain IQ or ability?)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Currently, the reasoning above is scattered across many different blog posts, comments, articles, and so forth. It is difficult to answer questions like &#x201C;Where and how do people who give consideration to the giver&#x2019;s dilemma donate?&#x201D; and &#x201C;Where do people who share my population ethics and worldview donate?&#x201D;</p>\n<p>It seems plausible that DLW could make progress on aggregating some of this discussion and linking it with the existing donations data.</p>\n<h4>Classify cause areas better</h4>\n<p>Although donations on DLW are usually tagged with a cause area, so far this has been done in a somewhat ad hoc manner, so there are some problems like the same cause area being phrased in different ways and the cause area hierarchy being a mess.</p>\n<p>I did some work on this previously in a cause prioritization context (see entries for <a href=\"https://causeprioritization.org/Cause_area_classification\">cause area classification</a> and <a href=\"https://causeprioritization.org/List_of_classifications_of_philanthropy\">list of classifications of philanthropy</a> on the <a href=\"https://causeprioritization.org/\">Cause Prioritization Wiki</a>), but this sort of work is also valuable for better classifying donations.</p>\n<h4>Include giving data (of existing donors/donees) in a more timely manner</h4>\n<p>Even after we add donations data for a donor or donee, new donations are made over time, so there is a question of how often DLW should update the data for existing donors and donees. Currently the updating schedule is somewhat arbitrary.</p>\n<p>We have written up a <a href=\"https://github.com/vipulnaik/donations/blob/master/data-update-playbook.md\">series of steps</a> for updating existing data for donors and donees, so updating donations data for most entities is pretty straightforward.</p>\n<h4>Include giving data (of existing donors/donees) more completely</h4>\n<p>Occasionally a subset of donations made by an entity is easy to access and process by a machine, while the rest are not. An example of this is the Gates Foundation, where donations tracked through the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Aid_Transparency_Initiative\">International Aid Transparency Initiative</a> are easy to process, but where the rest of the donations are difficult to process at the grant level.</p>\n<h4>Add more documents</h4>\n<p>There has been a lot of discussion over the years about effective giving, personal donations, organization updates, and other documents that would belong on DLW. We have added only a fraction of the possible documents, so adding more is another option.</p>\n<h4>Add more graphs</h4>\n<p>Generally we try to add graphs for each table displayed, but there are some exceptions like the donee page.</p>\n<h4>Summarize existing data more</h4>\n<p>It might be the case that the data of interest is already part of DLW, but isn&#x2019;t presented in the most useful way. Examples of this are <a href=\"https://github.com/vipulnaik/donations/issues/71\">donor intersection pages</a> and donee intersection pages, where one wants to compare two specific donors or two specific donees.</p>\n<h3>Other features?</h3>\n<p>We are interested in hearing ideas other than the ones we listed.</p>\n<h2>Acknowledgments</h2>\n<p>Thanks to Vipul Naik for feedback on this post and for funding my work on it.</p></body></html>", "user": {"username": "riceissa"}}, {"_id": "93GmXP8ikHhQzjs2i", "title": "What is the Most Helpful Categorical Breakdown of Normative Ethics?", "postedAt": "2018-08-15T20:24:31.312Z", "htmlBody": "<html><body><p>In general, I&apos;ve seen philosophers &quot;bucket&quot; normative ethics into 3 primary categories:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Virtue Ethics: Emphasize&#xA0;moral character</li>\n<li>Deontology: Emphasizes duties or rules</li>\n<li>Consequentialism: Emphasizes the consequences of actions</li>\n</ul>\n<p>See <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20170409002252/https://philpapers.org/surveys/results.pl\">here</a> or <a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ethics-virtue/\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>However, I would prefer to&#xA0;combine virtue ethics and deontology to create a&#xA0;binary distinction:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Means: Virtue Ethics&#xA0;and Deontology</li>\n<li>Ends: Consequentialism</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I&apos;m not an expert philosopher by any means (heh), but this makes more intuitive sense to me.

We at CEA thought it would be helpful to share some of our thinking on community building and representativeness in EA.</p><p>This post comprises four sections:</p><ol><li><strong>Why work to build the EA community?</strong> - why we prioritize building the EA community and think this is a promising area for people to work in.</li><li><strong>The challenges of prioritization</strong> - how prioritizing some activities can present challenges for community building and representativeness.</li><li><strong>CEA wants to support other community builders</strong> - how we can do better by working with other organizations and individuals.</li><li><strong>Our views on representativeness in EA</strong> - why we believe EA should be <a href=\"https://www.effectivealtruism.org/articles/understanding-cause-neutrality/#1-cause-impartiality\">cause-impartial</a>, but CEA\u2019s work should be mostly <a href=\"https://www.effectivealtruism.org/articles/understanding-cause-neutrality/#4-cause-generality\">cause-general</a>, and involve more description of community priorities as they are.</li></ol><p></p><h2>Why work to build the EA community?</h2><p>Ultimately, CEA wants to improve the world as much as possible. This means we want to do things that evidence and reason suggest are particularly high impact.</p><p>In order to make progress on understanding the world, or in solving any of the world\u2019s most pressing problems, we are going to need dedicated, altruistic people who are thinking carefully about how to act. Those people can have a much higher impact if they are guided by and can add to cutting-edge ideas, have access to the necessary resources (e.g. money) and can coordinate with one another.</p><p>Due to this need, we think one way we can have significant impact is by building a global community of people who have made helping others a core part of their lives, and who use evidence and reason to figure out how to do so as effectively as possible.</p><p>This is why we consider working on building the EA community a <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/coaching/\">priority path</a> for those looking to have an impact with their career. Work done to bring people or resources into the community, or to help build on our ideas and coordination capacity, can <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/promoting-effective-altruism/\">multiply our impact several-fold</a> even if we change our minds about which problems are most pressing in the future.</p><p>(You can see some considerations against working on EA community building <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/promoting-effective-altruism/#why-not-to-work-on-this-area\">here</a>.)</p><h2>The challenge of prioritization</h2><p>CEA\u2019s challenge is prioritization. Given that we have a finite amount of money, staff and management capacity, we have to choose where to focus our efforts. CEA cannot do everything that the EA community needs alone.</p><p>This year, we\u2019ve been primarily focusing on people who have already engaged a lot with the ideas and community associated with effective altruism, so that we can better understand what those people need and help them put their knowledge and dedication to good use. We think of this as analogous to focusing at the bottom of a <a href=\"https://www.centreforeffectivealtruism.org/the-funnel-model\">marketing funnel</a> and getting to know our \u201ccore users\u201d.</p><p>In practice, this has meant focusing on projects like running smaller retreats for people who are already highly engaged with EA and putting more attention on a smaller number of local groups, rather than trying to provide broad support to many.</p><p>Our plan has been to get these projects up and running and reliably doing valuable work before expanding our support <a href=\"https://www.centreforeffectivealtruism.org/the-funnel-model\">further up the funnel</a>. At this point, however, we are starting preparations to get more done higher in the funnel. Some valuable actions we\u2019d like to take up the funnel soon include running a broader range of events, funding more projects, and supporting more local groups. To achieve these new goals, we\u2019ve recently been looking to hire community specialists, events specialists, and an EA Grants Evaluator.</p><p>Inevitably, focusing on one area usually means deprioritizing other things that would also add a lot of value to the EA community. We try to mitigate some of the costs of prioritization by helping other groups provide support instead.</p><h2>CEA supports other community builders</h2><p>We generally encourage members of the EA community to get involved in building the EA community, especially in areas that are valuable but currently not prioritized by CEA. Because CEA is currently management and staff-constrained, the easiest way for us to support others is with funding, branding, and expertise.</p><p>Some actions we\u2019ve taken (or plan to take) to support the work of others include:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/6kFcr6L2jZhcsZnao/announcing-effective-altruism-community-building-grants\">Providing more than $650,000</a> to groups and individuals doing local community building (in progress).</li><li>Re-launching EA Grant applications to the public with a \u00a32,000,000 budget and a rolling application process (to be launched by the end of October 2018).</li><li>Helping groups run <a href=\"https://www.eaglobal.org/eagx/\">EAGx conferences</a> in their local areas by providing the brand, funding (both for the event and a stipend to organizers), and advice (this year we supported events in <a href=\"https://www.eaglobal.org/events/eagx-australia-2018/\">Australia</a>, <a href=\"https://www.eaglobal.org/events/eagx-boston-2018/\">Boston</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.eaglobal.org/events/eagx-netherlands/\">the Netherlands</a>).</li><li>Supporting Rethink Charity\u2019s work on LEAN with a $50,000 grant (grant provided).</li><li>Supporting Charity Entrepreneurship\u2019s work to build new EA charities with a $100,000 grant (grant currently being finalized).</li><li>Supporting the LessWrong 2.0 team with a $75,000 grant.</li><li>Supporting the EA Summit with a $10,000 grant.</li></ul><p>There\u2019s certainly more we can do to support the work others are doing, and we\u2019ll be on the lookout for more opportunities in the future.</p><h2>The EA Summit</h2><p>A recent example of one of the ways we\u2019re trying to support non-CEA community building efforts is by supporting the <a href=\"https://www.easummit2018.com/\">EA Summit</a>, which took place last weekend. The EA Summit was a small conference for EA community builders, incubated by Paradigm Academy with participation from CEA, Charity Science, and the Local Effective Altruism Network (LEAN), a project of Rethink Charity.</p><p>In late June, Peter Buckley and Mindy McTeigue approached Kerry and Larissa to discuss their concerns around a growing bias towards inaction in the EA community and a slowdown in efforts to build a robust, thriving EA community. We decided that these were important problems and that the EA Summit was a good mechanism for addressing them, so we were happy to support the project.</p><p>The largest consideration against support was based on the concern that the Summit was incubated by Paradigm Academy, which is closely connected to Leverage Research. We concluded that this was not a compelling reason to avoid supporting the conference. The EA Summit was a transparent project of clear value to the EA community.</p><p>Three CEA staff members attended the conference with Kerry providing the closing keynote. Our impression was that the conference was a success. Despite being organized on short notice, the event had over 100 attendees, was well run, and ended with an excellent party. Attendees seemed to come away with the message that there are useful projects they can work on that CEA would support, and overall had overwhelmingly positive things to say about the conference.</p><p>However, the fact that Paradigm incubated the Summit and Paradigm is connected to Leverage led some members of the community to express concern or confusion about the relationship between Leverage and the EA community. We will address this in a separate post in the near future. [Edit: We decided not to work on this post at this time.]</p><h2>EA and Representativeness</h2><p>One area the EA Summit aimed to address was concern about <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/2qGL7FoTEZTwp38ij/problems-with-ea-representativeness-and-how-to-solve-it\">representativeness</a> in EA, most recently raised by Joey Savoie. The question of how CEA should represent the EA community is one we\u2019ve thought about and discussed internally for some time. We plan to write a separate post on this, but here is an outline of our thinking so far. We believe the EA Forum should be a place for everyone to share and build upon ideas and models, so we\u2019d love to see discussion of this here.</p><p>On representativeness, our current view is that:</p><ol><li>The EA community should be <a href=\"https://www.effectivealtruism.org/articles/understanding-cause-neutrality/#1-cause-impartiality\">cause-impartial</a>, but not <a href=\"https://www.effectivealtruism.org/articles/understanding-cause-neutrality/#2-cause-agnosticism\">cause-agnostic</a>.</li><li>CEA\u2019s work should be broadly <a href=\"https://www.effectivealtruism.org/articles/understanding-cause-neutrality/#4-cause-generality\">cause-general</a>.</li><li>Some of CEA\u2019s work should be descriptive of what is happening in the community, but some of our work should also be prescriptive, meaning that it is based on our best guess as to what will have the largest impact.</li><li>We\u2019re unsure who our work should be representative of.</li><li>While we took some steps to address representativeness prior to Joey\u2019s post, we welcome suggestions on how we can improve.</li></ol><p><strong>The EA community should be cause-impartial:</strong></p><p>EA is about figuring out how to do the most good and then doing it. This means we don\u2019t favor any particular beneficiaries, approaches or cause areas from the start, but instead select causes based on an impartial calculation of impact (<a href=\"https://www.effectivealtruism.org/articles/understanding-cause-neutrality/#1-cause-impartiality\">cause-impartiality</a>). This in turn means we should be both seeking to reduce our uncertainty about the relevant impact of different causes and seeking to find new areas that could potentially be even more important (see <a href=\"https://www.effectivealtruism.org/articles/three-heuristics-for-finding-cause-x/\">Three Heuristics for Finding Cause X</a> for some ideas on how this might be done). </p><p>Success for the EA community should include a strong possibility that we learn more, change our minds, and therefore no longer work on causes that we once thought were important.</p><p><strong>CEA\u2019s work should be broadly cause-general:</strong></p><p>The reason we have an EA community instead of individual communities focused on specific causes is:</p><ol><li>We don\u2019t know for certain what causes are most important and we may discover a new Cause X in the future.</li><li>We don\u2019t know for certain which approaches to existing causes are most important and we may discover new approaches in the future.</li><li>Despite our uncertainty, we can take actions that are useful across many causes.</li></ol><p>CEA\u2019s work should be broadly beneficial regardless of one\u2019s views on the relative importance of different causes. This is why our mission is to build the EA community. We believe our comparative advantage lies in finding and coordinating with people who can work on important problems.</p><p><strong>CEA\u2019s work as both descriptive and prescriptive:</strong></p><p>While most of our work is cause-general, there will be cases where we have opportunities to support work in particular cause areas that we currently believe are likely to have the highest impact.</p><p>We think it is therefore helpful to make a distinction between aspects of CEA\u2019s work that are descriptive and those that are more prescriptive.</p><p>Descriptive work aims to reflect what is actually happening in the EA community; the kinds of projects people are working on and issues people are thinking about. The <a href=\"https://www.effectivealtruism.org/ea-newsletter-archives/\">EA Newsletter</a> is a clear example of this because it includes updates from around the community and from a variety of EA and EA-adjacent organizations.</p><p>Other aspects of CEA\u2019s work should be prescriptive, meaning that they involve taking a view on where the community should be headed or on what causes are likely to be most important.

I am building a simple model of so-called &#x201C;<a href=\"https://foundational-research.org/msr\">multiverse-wide cooperation via superrationality</a>&#x201D; (MSR).&#xA0;The model&#xA0;should incorporate the most relevant uncertainties for determining possible gains from trade. To be able to make this model maximally useful, I would like to ask others for their opinions on the idea of MSR. For instance, what are the main reasons you think MSR might be irrelevant or might not work as it is supposed to work? Which questions are unanswered and need to be addressed before being able to assess the merit of the idea? I would be happy about any input in the comments to this post or via mail to <a href=\"mailto:johannes@foundational-research.org\">johannes@foundational-research.org</a>.</p>\n<p>An overview of resources on MSR, including introductory texts, can be found on the link above. To briefly illustrate the idea, consider two artificial agents with identical source code playing a prisoner&#x2019;s dilemma. Even if both agents cannot causally interact, one agent&#x2019;s action provides them with strong evidence about the other agent&#x2019;s action. Evidential decision theory and recently proposed variants of causal decision theory (<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.05060\">Yudkowsky and Soares, 2018</a>; <a href=\"http://kops.uni-konstanz.de/bitstream/handle/123456789/3505/Spohn_2003_Dependency_Equilibria.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y\">Spohn, 2003</a>; <a href=\"http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/9887/7/newcomb_in_ckps.pdf\">Poellinger, 2013</a>) say that agents should take such evidence into account when making decisions. MSR is based on the idea that (i) humans on Earth are in a similar situation as the two AI agents: there probably is a large or infinite multiverse containing many exact copies of humans on Earth (<a href=\"http://space.mit.edu/home/tegmark/multiverse.pdf\">Tegmark 2003, p. 464</a>), but also agents similar but non-identical to humans. (ii) If humans and these other, similar agents take each other&#x2019;s preferences into account, then, due to gains from trade, everyone is better off than if everyone were to pursue only their own ends. It follows from (i) and (ii) that humans should take the preferences of other, similar agents in the multiverse into account, to produce the evidence that they do in turn take humans&#x2019; preferences into account, which leaves everyone better off.</p>\n<p>According to Oesterheld (<a href=\"https://foundational-research.org/files/Multiverse-wide-Cooperation-via-Correlated-Decision-Making.pdf\">2017, sec. 4</a>), this idea could have far-reaching implications for prioritization. For instance, given MSR, some forms of moral advocacy could become ineffective: advocating for their particular values provides agents with evidence that others do the same, potentially neutralizing each other&#x2019;s efforts. Moreover, MSR could play a role in deciding which strategies&#xA0;to pursue in AI alignment. It could become especially valuable to ensure an AGI will engage in a multiverse-wide trade.</p></body></html>", "user": {"username": "Johannes_Treutlein"}}, {"_id": "pSWwYLJKquZa55WWA", "title": "Fisher & Syed on Tradable Obligations to Enhance Health", "postedAt": "2018-08-12T22:17:20.304Z", "htmlBody": "<html><body><h1>Prefatory Note</h1>\n<p><em>The purpose of this post is to inform readers of a global health policy proposal that I suspect many will find exciting. Since the original text is freely available, I only briefly describe it here so readers can quickly ascertain whether it interests them.</em></p>\n<h1>Fisher &amp; Syed on &quot;Tradable Obligations to Enhance Health&quot;</h1>\n<p>In their forthcoming book&#xA0;<a href=\"https://cyber.harvard.edu/people/tfisher/Infection.htm\"><u>Infection</u></a>, law professors William Fisher (Harvard)* and Talha Syed (Berkeley) explore &quot;The Health Crisis in the Developing World and What We Should Do About It.&quot; Obviously, EAs generally need little introduction to this problem. As law professors, their &quot;goal is to determine how the laws and institutions that we have historically employed to foster the creation of new pharmaceutical products and then to channel the distribution of those products might be adjusted so as both to generate more vaccines and drugs that address neglected diseases and then to make those vaccines and drugs available to the people who need them.&quot; (<a href=\"https://cyber.harvard.edu/people/tfisher/Infection_Introduction.pdf\">Introduction</a>, p. 22).</p>\n<p>Some of the proposals they consider&#x2014;and ultimately find unsatisfying&#x2014;include mandatory research (<a href=\"https://cyber.harvard.edu/people/tfisher/Infection_Regulations.pdf\">ch. 6</a>, pp. 3&#x2013;5), price regulation, (id. pp. 5&#x2013;7), mandatory licensing (id. pp. 7&#x2013;10), and foreign filing licenses (id. pp. 11&#x2013;13).</p>\n<p>Their main proposal&#x2014;and the subject of this post&#x2014;is essentially a tradable DALY quota system:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Each pharmaceutical firm would be required to achieve, each year, a ratio, which we will call the social-responsibility index (SRI). The numerator of this index would be the total number of Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) saved as a result of the distribution and consumption of the firm&#x2019;s products during the year. The denominator would be a measure of the firm&#x2019;s size, presumptively its global gross revenues during the year.</p>\n<p>Like&#xA0;[greenhouse gas]&#xA0;emission permits [as in cap-and-trade schemes], the DALYs in this regime would be both tradeable and bankable. Thus, a firm that, in a given year, failed to earn enough DALYs to meet its target could purchase DALYs from a firm that had a surplus. For example, a firm specializing in so-called &#x201C;lifestyle&#x201D; products (such as erectile-dysfunction drugs, sales of which are lucrative but result in only modest health benefits) could buy DALYs from a firm specializing in vaccines or drugs efficacious in preventing or treating more serious diseases or conditions. Alternatively, a firm that, in a given year, earned more that enough DALYs to satisfy its obligations, instead of selling the surplus could apply it to the firm&#x2019;s account for the following year.</p>\n<p>Like the [Corporate Average Fuel Economy] standards, our proposed regime would permit each firm to decide how it could most efficiently comply with its obligation. A firm at risk of missing its target would have (at least) the following options:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>It could reduce the prices charged in developing countries for drugs already in its portfolio, thereby increasing the number of persons able to afford the drugs and earning more DALYs.</li>\n<li>It could alter the formulations of drugs already in its portfolio so that they could be distributed more easily in developing countries &#x2013; for example, by making them more heat resistant and thus easier to distribute in areas without reliable &#x201C;cold chains.&#x201D;</li>\n<li>It could increase its investment in research projects that promise to generate drugs with large health benefits (for example, vaccines for infectious diseases).</li>\n<li>It could alter its business-acquisition policies to acquire more &#x201C;startup&#x201D; biotechnology companies that have developed products that offer large health benefits.</li>\n<li>It could collaborate with governments or NGOs in developing countries to improve the distribution systems for its drugs, thereby getting them into more mouths.</li>\n<li>It could, as mentioned above, buy DALYs from other firms better positioned to improve public health.</li>\n<li>Finally, it could reduce the prices of some or all of its products, thereby lowering the denominator of its ratio. (For obvious reasons, this is the option the firm is least likely to adopt.)</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I suspect many EAs, like me, will find this proposal compelling because it&#xA0;combines both the power of markets and the regulatory power of developed governments to effect systemic changes in global healthcare delivery.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>If you&apos;d like to read more, this proposal is developed from page 14 onwards in&#xA0;<a href=\"https://cyber.harvard.edu/people/tfisher/Infection_Regulations.pdf\">Chapter 6 of Infection</a>.

He attacks a basic tension in the views defended by several preceding philosophers: that it is permissible to be selfish, and nice to donate to the best charity, but *wrong* to donate to an ineffective charity. The prima facie contradiction should be obvious. How is it that my actions go from being permissible to being impermissible as they become more generous and more beneficial?<br><br>But in defense of that view, other authors have provided some reasonably compelling thought experiments. Suppose that I can do nothing or, at great cost to myself, I can save a man from losing either one or both of his arms. It seems reasonable to say that I can do nothing, as part of the general idea that morality doesn&apos;t demand us to sacrifice all the time. And it seems reasonable to say that saving both the man&apos;s arms at great personal cost would be praiseworthy and supererogatory. But to accept the same personal cost and yet only save one of the man&apos;s arms just seems perverse.<br><br>McMahan argues extensively about this and other thought experiments to show that the analogy fails to apply to charity. Once we revise such thought experiments to be similar in structure to donations, we no longer find them to be compelling. But McMahan never addresses a much more simple solution to these arguments, which is to deny that the selfish option is permissible in the first place. McMahan briefly mentions this as a potential response: <br><br>&quot;A different strategy for effective altruists is to try to develop a robust defense of the demandingness of morality, according to which much less of doing good is supererogatory than we have hitherto supposed.&quot;<br><br>The way he presents it is odd: given the basic demanding arguments of consequentialism, Singer&apos;s demanding argument which formed the basis for the EA movement, the demanding donation practices of many EAs, and the fact there are good existing arguments against the demandingness objection, I would think that this should be treated as the default position. McMahan&apos;s argument can be taken to show that it&apos;s much more plausible than the mindset held by some EAs, which is that it&apos;s a free personal decision whether you want to give a lot of money to charity, but that that money must then be given to an effective one.</p></body></html>", "user": {"username": "kbog"}}, {"_id": "2RfQT7cybfS8zoy43", "title": "Are men more likely to attend EA London events?

Marketing events differently to attract more women seems unnecessary. We don&#x2019;t have a problem attracting women; we are just less likely to retain them.</p>\n<p>EA London events aimed at newcomers tend to be gender balanced, while socials and strategy meetings are heavily male. This makes sense: we&#x2019;d expect newcomer events to be gender-balanced because 47% of attendees at EA London events are female and 50% of attendees who only attend one event are female. Given that &#xBE; of regular attendees are male, we&#x2019;d expect strategy meetings to be male-dominated. It&#x2019;s more surprising that the monthly pub social was so heavily male, given that it was advertised to newcomers. However, a group of men who are quite involved in EA London regularly attend the monthly pub socials, which may explain why they skew male.</p>\n<p>It&#x2019;s not obvious why women are less likely to return to EA London events. I&#x2019;m currently doing some qualitative research to investigate what motivates men and women to attend EA London events. I plan to publish it within the next month.</p>\n<h2>Next Steps</h2>\n<p>EA London attracts a near-equal number of men and women to its events, but men are more likely to return to future events. We don&#x2019;t yet know why this happens, but it skews socials and strategy meetings male.</p>\n<p>It could be useful for other communities to track their attendance and see if they find similar results. A series of interviews with women from different EA communities who have stopped attending events would also be helpful.</p>\n<p>*We made rather simplistic assumptions for this research, based on people&#x2019;s names and gender presentation. I recognize that not everyone feels comfortable with this binary. Nevertheless, I hope that this research will be a step toward making EA London more welcoming to a wider range of people.</p></body></html>", "user": {"username": "Khorton"}}, {"_id": "ACdHpmmmtxMXxbjno", "title": "Local Community Building Funnel and Activities - EA Geneva", "postedAt": "2018-08-09T08:22:13.543Z", "htmlBody": "<pre><code>\u00a0</code></pre><h2>1. Intro</h2><p>While other groups might find their local reality to differ substantially, we (the EA Geneva team) hope to convey some useful general insights by sharing what our community building efforts look like nowadays, and why.\u00a0</p><p>Our experience comes from three years of building up:</p><ol><li>A small local community next to our studies (2015-2017); and</li><li>An increasingly diverse association with full-time staff since July 2017.</li></ol><p></p><p>This first post is structured as follows:</p><ol><li>Intro</li><li>The engagement funnel</li><li>Activity details</li><li>Sub-communities</li></ol><h2>2. The engagement funnel</h2><p>This post documents our current model of building a local EA community.</p><p>Our funnel captures the essential activities that have shown promise in fostering people\u2019s journey into EA. We have not reached our current ideal design, though, and will likely make changes to it in the future.</p><p></p><span><figure><img src=\"https://postimg.cc/image/tnwd40ckd/\" class=\"draft-image \" style=\"\" /></figure></span><span><figure><img src=\"https://s22.postimg.cc/is4z8d9jl/Post_on_Community_Funnel_-_First_draft.png\" class=\"draft-image \" style=\"\" /></figure></span><p></p><p>Generally, the funnel serves two goals:</p><ul><li>Impact: realise our local community\u2019s potential on a global level (mainly by encouraging people to go into top priority roles); and</li><li>Health: build a locally anchored community that is exemplary of <a href=\"https://www.centreforeffectivealtruism.org/ceas-guiding-principles/\">the guiding principles of EA</a> (mainly through personal interaction, self-development &amp; collective thought development).</li></ul><h3>2.1 - Key models for community tactics</h3><p>As highlighted through <a href=\"https://srconstantin.wordpress.com/2017/08/08/the-craft-is-not-the-community/\">the craft is not the community</a>, actually causing externally verifiable impact often feels like it interferes with serving the internal needs of the group, especially when starting out. Developing explicit models of our key audiences and their paths through the funnel has helped us to work out a somewhat balanced two-pronged, goal-driven approach.</p><p>Our key audiences are:</p><ul><li>Students (undergrads &amp; graduates)</li><li>Early career professionals (PhDs, postdocs, trainees, junior positions)</li><li>Professionals (35+ y.o.)</li></ul><p></p><p>We try to identify valuable modes of engagement to contribute to people\u2019s development depending on their</p><ul><li>Position in the <a href=\"https://www.centreforeffectivealtruism.org/a-three-factor-model-of-community-building\">three-factor model</a>;</li><li>Personal situation; and</li><li>Length of stay in Geneva.</li></ul><p></p><p>We see three general development stages\u00a0that our activities have to serve:</p><ol><li>Attraction: attracting people with high impact potential;</li><li>Education: developing their knowledge and skills; and</li><li>Engagement: consolidating their paths to contribution.</li></ol><p>They theoretically appear to be sequenced but we found they are tightly interrelated in practice. Most of our activities nowadays serve more than one stage, as you will see below.</p><p></p><p>In parallel, two meta activities are part of our community building:</p><ul><li>Local coordination: coordinating local activities; and</li><li>Global integration: tying everything into the global community.</li></ul><p>Local coordination is the subject of post 4 in this series. Global integration deserves an entirely separate discussion.</p><h3>2.2 - Segmenting the community</h3><p>To keep segments relevant yet simple, we decided on three <a href=\"https://www.centreforeffectivealtruism.org/the-concentric-circles-model\">concentric circles</a>:</p><ol><li>Public: anyone (potentially) interested;</li><li>Member: individuals having completed our introduction workshop; and</li><li>Core: individuals having completed our advanced workshop.</li></ol><p>One can join the member segment without a workshop if two core members, after a 1-on-1 each, judge that one has demonstrated full knowledge of the subjects of the intro curriculum. We do not currently plan to make such exceptions for the advanced workshop.</p><p></p><span><figure><img src=\"https://s22.postimg.cc/hpuspsvv5/Post_on_Community_Funnel_-_First_draft_1.png\" class=\"draft-image \" style=\"\" /></figure></span><p></p><p>To realise our community\u2019s potential, the funnel is thought to actively drive people towards</p><ol><li>A better understanding of the world and EA;</li><li>Growing engagement and responsibilities within the community; and</li><li>Increasing access to resources, activities and infrastructure.</li></ol><p></p><p>We expect this way of <a href=\"https://medium.com/@ThingMaker/open-problems-in-group-rationality-5636440a2cd1\">escalating asks and rewards</a> to result in more meaningful activities for all segments and to motivate people to move further down the funnel. The key drivers from segment to segment are the workshops.</p><p></p><ul><li>Publicly accessible activities:</li><ul><li>Themed socials</li><li>Introduction workshop</li><li>Introduction talks to promising audiences</li><li>Ad hoc events (often in collaboration with other organisations)</li></ul><li>Members and core:</li><ul><li>Activities</li><ul><li>Working groups</li><li>Sub-communities</li><li>Members-only themed socials</li></ul><li>Others</li><ul><li>Access to internal communications platform</li><li>Access to educational resources</li><li>Possibility for peer mentoring</li><li>Access to community coworking and hangout space</li></ul></ul><li>Core:</li><ul><li>Self-improvement group</li><li>Workshop facilitator training</li><li>Discussion dinners</li></ul></ul><h3>2.3 - The minimum viable funnel</h3><p>Thinking back to the beginnings of EA Geneva, we expect that we would have learned a lot faster if we had exclusively focused on building up the core activities that we, today, perceive as the backbone of the funnel.</p><p></p><span><figure><img src=\"https://s22.postimg.cc/t27e7ljzl/Post_on_Community_Funnel_-_First_draft_2.png\" class=\"draft-image \" style=\"\" /></figure></span><p></p><p>Especially in the beginning, meaningfully broadening the range of our activities proved difficult and most of it seems to have been a waste of time in hindsight. Developing the capacity to maintain this core funnel structure would have:</p><ul><li>forced us to focus on learning about all the key topics; and</li><li>given us a set of activities allowing to integrate new contributors more effectively.</li></ul><p></p><p>From the start, 1-on-1s seem among the most effective ways to identify potential core members, address doubts, establish common knowledge, and develop someone\u2019s mode of contribution.</p><p>To build the knowledge, experience and skills necessary to run public workshops, we think it can be useful to start off by using the themed socials to study the subjects of the curricula of the intro workshop and advanced workshop (linked in the descriptions below). Depending on what the core group feels comfortable with, these exploratory sessions could be public, invite-only or somewhere in-between. For very small groups, the curricula could also be content of 1-on-1s.</p><p>Upon sign up to an intro workshop, sending out EA reading recommendations helps us to further automate selection with two main purposes:</p><ul><li>Forestalling that people come to the events with faulty ideas about EA (e.g. interpreting EA to mean \u201chelping where you can see the impact with your own eyes\u201d); and</li><li>Making sure people are sufficiently proactive and open-minded such that a session is productive (people commit to 30 min of reading when signing up).</li></ul><p></p><p>Presenting the group, its goals, its activities, and its principles explicitly at the beginning of each public event also helps people to identify with the group - or not; motivates new contributors; and solidifies the group identity.</p><p>To complement these key efforts, explicitly making the time for regular self-improvement group meetings to work on the core members\u2019 personal development helps to set the tone for the broader community culture. Proactively sharing and discussing feedback on room for personal improvements, group dynamics and organisational optimisation has proven invaluable to us as individuals, as a team, and for the community. For us, these sessions will stay invite-only to preserve the necessary intimacy needed to work on personal bottlenecks together.</p><h2>3. Activity details</h2><p>These are all the activities that we are currently organising as parts of our funnel:</p><p></p><span><figure><img src=\"https://s22.postimg.cc/9x44xud1d/Post_on_Community_Funnel_-_First_draft_3.png\" class=\"draft-image \" style=\"\" /></figure></span><p></p><p>Below, we detail them out. Priorities might change according to various considerations, among them:</p><ol><li>Evolving activities: some formats (can/should) change with the maturity of a group (e.g. introduction workshops: from self-study to public-facing workshop); and</li><li>Group-dependent activities: adaptations based on e.g. specialities, needs, interests, and local strategy.</li></ol><h3>1-on-1 meetings</h3><ul><li>Purpose</li><ul><li>Advance someone\u2019s career planning;</li><li>Advance someone\u2019s understanding of EA-related topics;</li><li>Advance someone\u2019s involvement in the local community;

Sub-communities</h2><p>We see sub-communities as a subset of the fractal that is our local group, which is a subset of the fractal that is the global community. We are still unsure about the best conditions to start these but think that any community above some critical mass of active core members will likely benefit from regrouping.</p><ul><li>Purpose</li><ul><li>Make space for members with different profiles to build their own mode of engagement and contribution</li><li>Foster the right kinds of diversity under a common goal</li></ul><li>Details</li><ul><li>Have to be lead by at least two core members;</li><li>Have to integrate into the organisational structure;</li><li>Can organise any of the activities outlined above for their audience;</li><li>Can be organised around a topic or specific demographic;</li><ul><li>If topical, events can be organised by the group for any audience, depending on the content and format;</li><li>If demographic, the group will likely benefit from staying exclusive.</li></ul></ul><li>Remarks</li><ul><li>Avoid fracturing the community: sub-communities should not tear apart the existing community but make space for more engagement by clearly defined subsets of our members;</li><li>Choice of coordination mechanisms, leadership, focus and approach are of great importance;</li><ul><li>Has to fit into the broader local community building strategy.</li><li>Groups will become a force of themselves within the local community;</li><ul><li>Ensure a maximum of coordination from the start;</li><li>Make sure to have the capacity to give adequate support and foster integration;</li></ul><li>Potential downside risks need to be made explicit.</li></ul></ul></ul><h3>Examples</h3><ul><li>Student communities</li><ul><li>Uni of Geneva</li><li>IHEID</li></ul><li>Communities of specific demographics</li><ul><li>35+yo professionals</li><li>Residents of Lausanne</li><li>Earning-to-Givers</li></ul><li>Communities of common interests</li><ul><li>AI Safety</li><li>Philanthropy</li><li>Policy</li></ul></ul><h3>Self-improvement for world-improvement community</h3><p>A slightly special sub-community that we think deserves more attention, is a self-improvement community. This means, expanding the exclusive self-improvement group(s) to the entire community. From where we are standing, it looks like the only way the EA community will have long-lasting impact, or will itself last the test of time, is if people find a tribe within it. Self-care, cultivating compassion and applied rationality, we hope, might help to build a basis that does not just create further in-group vs. out-group dynamics.</p><ul><li>\u00a0Purpose</li><ul><li>Establish a self-improvement community</li></ul><li>Details</li><ul><li>Examples of regular activities:</li><ul><li>Structured feedback</li><li>AR tutoring wheel</li><li>AR technique revision</li><li>Individual debugging</li><li>Pair debugging</li><li>Circling</li></ul><li>Examples of on-going activities:</li><ul><li>Prediction markets</li><li>Accountability pairing</li><li>Peer-mentoring</li></ul></ul></ul><pre><code>Co-written by Nora Ammann and Konrad Seifert.</code></pre>", "user": {"username": "konrad"}}, {"_id": "iY5cAnfDg78F3mNtr", "title": "Announcing WASR's Grants Competition", "postedAt": "2018-08-09T01:47:59.709Z", "htmlBody": "<html><body><p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>[Cross-posting from the Wild-Animal Suffering Research (WASR) project - </span><a href=\"https://was-research.org/grants-competition-2018/\"><span>original post available here</span></a><span>]</span></p>\n<p><span>---</span></p>\n<h2><span>Our Focus</span></h2>\n<p><span>The WASR project has </span><a href=\"https://was-research.org/research-plan/\"><span>two main research goals</span></a><span>:</span></p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><span>To better understand wild-animal suffering; and</span></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><span>To identify viable policies to reduce this suffering.</span></p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><a href=\"https://was-research.org/research-plan/\"><span>Our research plan</span></a><span> focuses on a variety of areas of investigation including: fostering wild animal welfare research in academia; better understanding positive and negative experiences in the wild; and a better understanding of wildlife management practices. Our overarching goal is to determine how we can reduce suffering in the wild. </span></p>\n<h2><span>Proposals</span></h2>\n<p><span>With the above goals in mind, we are launching a small scale grants competition. We plan to disburse $35,000 in total among a small number of proposals. Proposals should be relevant to our mission and written in English.

We believe this should be the primary metric for measuring the success of our program.</span></strong></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>Aside from the workshop model, SHIC is maintaining a scaled-down version of our Student Leader program due to a couple of notable successes. </span><strong><span>We will also explore how the SHIC program can be implemented in a university setting.</span></strong></p>\n<p><a></a></p>\n<h1><strong>Our Current Strategy<br></strong></h1>\n<p><strong><strong><span>In Autumn 2017, we released <a href=\"/ea/1gb/revised_shic_impact_approach/\">a post</a> detailing our reasons for turning away from our Student Leader model of supporting interested students in implementing the SHIC program for their peers around the world. Our current workshop-based model focuses on higher-quality content delivery and data collection.</span></strong></strong></p>\n<p><strong><span>Since our strategic pivot, SHIC carried out the following:<br></span></strong><strong></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><span><strong><span>Prepared two &#x2018;SHIC Instructors&#x2019; to run workshops in high schools.<sup><a href=\"#fn1\">1</a></sup></span></strong></span></strong></li>\n<li><strong><span><strong><span><strong><span>Reformatted and consolidated the SHIC program to fit into 3-5 hours of programming</span><span>&#x2014;</span><span> the amount of time we recommended schools provide for our workshops.</span></strong></span></strong></span></strong></li>\n<li><strong><span><strong><span><strong><span><strong><span>Reached out to high schools throughout the greater Vancouver area.</span></strong></span></strong></span></strong></span></strong></li>\n<li><strong><span><strong><span><strong><span><strong><span><strong><span>Presented 41 workshops in 16 schools to 855 students in the greater Vancouver area, gathering data, including surveys and charity choices,<sup><a href=\"#fn2\">2</a></sup> in the process.</span></strong></span></strong></span></strong></span></strong></span></strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>&#xA0;<strong><span>There are several reasons we&#x2019;ve found this model to be a stronger fit with our overarching goals:</span></strong></p>\n<h2><strong><span>1. Controlling content delivery. </span></strong></h2>\n<p><strong><span><strong><span>With our previous model, student leaders had the opportunity to run as little or as much of the SHIC program as they wished, cherry-picking elements of the program that suited their needs or starting the program without finishing it. While we agree that some of the program is better than none at all, we also feel like many were missing out on the impact of SHIC as a cohesive narrative; a program that ties many ideas into a set of overarching concepts.</span></strong></span></strong></p>\n<h2><strong><span><strong><span>2. Having a presenter equipped with the knowledge to answer questions and respond to uncertainty. </span></strong></span></strong></h2>\n<p><strong><span><strong><span><strong><span>SHIC was created to spark interest and to provide foundational knowledge and skills. What a student chooses to build upon this foundation will vary with the individual. SHIC Instructors are knowledgeable enough in these concepts to guide students in the right direction. Student leaders would be less equipped to address concerns on the spot, which could lead to miscommunication or misunderstanding.</span></strong></span></strong></span></strong></p>\n<h2><strong><span><strong><span><strong><span>3. Controlling data collection. </span></strong></span></strong></span></strong></h2>\n<p><strong><span><strong><span><strong><span><strong><span>As we detailed in last year&#x2019;s post, our ability to collect post-program data was severely hindered by attrition. Most student leaders either failed to complete the entire program or were unable to gather sufficient survey data from participants. With our workshop model, we have stronger assurances that post-workshop data will be collected, either through direct contact with the teacher after we leave, or in many cases, by giving students time at the end of the workshop to complete a survey.</span></strong></span></strong></span></strong></span></strong></p>\n<h2><strong><span><strong><span><strong><span><strong><span>4. Beginning long-lasting dialogues with students with high potential. </span></strong></span></strong></span></strong></span></strong></h2>\n<p><strong><span><strong><span><strong><span><strong><span><strong><span>The interactiveness of the SHIC workshop allows a rapport to form between students and the Instructor, increasing the chances of us continuing the conversation after the workshop. It is far easier for a SHIC Instructor to identify students with a high interest and/or aptitude and engage them further. It is also clearer whom an interested student should approach for more information. SHIC is currently experimenting with structured methods by which student engagement can be extended. These are detailed in the &#x201C;Plans for Fall 2018&#x201D; section <a href=\"#plans\">below</a>. </span></strong></span></strong></span></strong></span></strong></span></strong></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><a></a></p>\n<h1><strong>Summary and Interpretation of Workshop Data<br></strong></h1>\n<p><a></a></p>\n<h2><strong>Outreach Data</strong></h2>\n<p><strong><strong><span>SHIC staff began reaching out to teachers within the greater Vancouver area in December 2017. Our primary method of onboarding schools was cold-emailing teachers of Grade 11 and 12 Social Studies, Social Justice, Theory of Knowledge or Philosophy. We also attended three teacher association meetings to promote our workshop. Of the 125 schools contacted, 25 (20%) responded with interest, and 16 (13%) invited SHIC into the classroom, a much higher response rate than we expected from cold emailing. Based on this, we are moderately confident that the SHIC program is scalable. By the end of the 2017-18 school year, SHIC had presented 25 full workshops (514 students) of three to five hours, and 16 short workshops (342 students) of one to one and a half hours</span><span>.<br><br></span></strong></strong></p>\n<p><a></a></p>\n<h2><strong>Quantitative Survey Data</strong></h2>\n<p><span>We administered surveys to students before and immediately after our full 3-5 hour workshops. </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>These surveys investigated changes in agreement or disagreement (6 point scale) with a range of statements about beliefs, attitudes, plans and behaviours. Students were also asked to select 2 (from a list of 5) factors that would be most important for them when choosing a charity. Two of these were coded as &#x2018;effective&#x2019; and scored (1), and three as &#x2018;not effective&#x2019; and scored (0). Students were also asked to choose a charity (or cause) to donate to and charities were coded as &#x2018;effective&#x2019; if they were recommended by selected charity evaluators, or otherwise mentioned in our workshop.<sup><a href=\"#fn3\">3</a></sup></span><span> In the pre-workshop survey, this was a free write-in response and donations were incentivised (a random sample of charities chosen received actual donations), and post-workshop the students were directed to our giving platform,<sup><a href=\"#fn4\">4</a></sup></span> </strong><strong><strong><span>where they were asked to donate the $10 they received from SHIC to the charity of their choice. </span></strong></strong></p>\n<p><strong><span>Data was somewhat limited due to practical difficulties in data collection (we received ~500 pre-workshop responses and ~300 post-workshop responses). In addition, only 168 pairs of responses could be matched, due to a large number of respondents failing to correctly enter their anonymous &#x2018;matching codes&#x2019; correctly. As a result, the final sample may be a more highly engaged/attentive self-selected sample.<br></span></strong><br><strong><span><strong><span>We conducted paired sample </span><span>t</span><span>-tests on the 168 matching responses.<sup><a href=\"#fn5\">5</a></sup></span></strong></span></strong></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://shicschools.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/2018SHICreportdata.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><strong><span>In the charity selection task, pre-workshop 325 students stated a charity, 1 of which was coded as an &#x2018;effective&#x2019; charity (0.3%). Post-workshop, 131 students stated a charity, 84 of which were &#x2018;effective&#x2019; charities (64%). It is reassuring that post-workshop a majority of respondents chose an effective charity, though this is likely partially due to increased familiarity (these charities just having been mentioned in the workshop).<br></span></strong><br><strong><span><strong><span>Funding totaling $4,400 CAD was provided to students through the online donation platform. $1,638 was directed to charities by the students, with $1,004 (61%) of donated money going to &#x2018;effective&#x2019; charities. The remaining $2,762 has yet to be donated.</span></strong></span></strong></p>\n<p><strong><span><strong><span><br></span></strong></span></strong><strong><span><strong><span><strong><span>We found significant, if small, improvements (by our standards) in knowledge, attitudes and values for the majority of our questions. We found null results for 3 items (&#x201C;I have a duty to take significant action to help people that are suffering.&#x201D; &#x201C;I plan to choose a career that will allow me to do as much good as I can&#x201D; &#x201C;I have compared charities against each other on my own time.&#x201D;) The first two of these may be partly explained by the high mean responses in the pre-workshop survey. The null result for students comparing charities &#x201C;on their own time&#x201D; is unsurprising as the post-workshop survey was administered immediately after the workshop, before most students would have had time to independently compare charities.</span></strong></span></strong></span></strong></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>On the whole, we view these results as fairly promising and slightly increase our confidence that SHIC workshops are having a positive effect on students beliefs and attitudes. </span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><strong><strong><strong><strong><span>Two significant limitations are high rates of respondent attrition and the likely influence of social desirability bias and/or demand effects, as it was likely clear (post-workshop) which were the desired responses. In addition, it is hard to get a sense of how significant the impact of these self-reported changes are. For these reasons, in future iterations we plan to place less emphasis on such survey data, focusing instead on evaluating our impact on behavioral changes with a smaller number of highly engaged students. Read more about our plans for further engagement in the &#x201C;Plans for Fall 2018&#x201D; section below. </span></strong></strong></strong></strong></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><a></a></p>\n<h2><strong>Qualitative Results<br></strong></h2>\n<p><strong><strong><span><strong><span><strong><span><strong><strong><strong><span>Every teacher we worked with gave us positive, sometimes glowing feedback, </span></strong></strong></strong></span></strong></span></strong></span></strong></strong><strong><span>and most &#xA0;expressed a desire to have us come to their school again. Some thought our workshop should be compulsory for all students, and some teachers later said that students continued to mention the content of the workshop weeks after we left. The response from students in the classroom was also very positive. In all classes, most students were engaged in the presentations, and in most classes, there were several students who participated in discussions enthusiastically.<br></span></strong><br><strong><span><strong><span>Our post workshop survey included a qualitative question: &#x201C;Has the SHIC program changed how you might act in the future? If so, how?&#x201D; There were 122 responses from the 176 students offered this question. 33 students described actions they would take as a result of the workshop, such as donating to better charities, donating more money, or consuming fewer animal products. 36 students gave responses stating their increased motivation to help others or something they had learned, and 13 stated that the SHIC workshop has not changed how they will act in the future. Overall these responses indicated a high level of endorsement of the ideas in the workshop, but it is hard to know how these responses will translate into future actions or impact.<br></span></strong></span></strong><br><strong><span><strong><span><strong><span>In order to get an understanding for interest levels beyond the workshop, at the end of the 2017-18 school year we extemporaneously attempted to re-engage students who had previously participated in a full SHIC workshop. We first worked to schedule an advanced workshop with interested students, but there was inadequate demand and we were unable to find a time that suited more than a few of the students, so the workshop did not go ahead. Further attempts to engage via one-on-one coaching also yielded no results. While this trial could potentially be indicative of insufficient student interest beyond the initial workshop, we feel that more planning (informing students of opportunities during the workshop and engaging shortly after) and better timing (not at the end of the school year) will result in more student engagement. We remain hopeful that future, more structured attempts to engage students will lead to a more fruitful uptake.</span></strong></span></strong></span></strong></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><a></a></p>\n<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>\n<p><strong><strong><span>Overall, though still ascertaining whether or not SHIC workshops are cost-effective relative to the impact of other movement building initiatives, we feel confident based on evidence thus far that we should continue to explore this strategy, and moderately confident that we should attempt to expand to other cities in early 2019. Impact assessments of our program will continue for the foreseeable future.</span></strong></strong></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><a></a></p>\n<h1><strong>Plans for Autumn 2018 and Beyond</strong></h1>\n<p><strong><strong><span>The most significant update we&#x2019;ve made since initiating the workshop experiment in January 2018 is placing more emphasis on the need to create an intentional engagement funnel through which high-potential students can continue their education.</span></strong></strong></p>\n<p><strong><strong><span><strong><span>Our current plan is to initiate engagement in two different ways:<br></span></strong></span></strong></strong><strong></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><strong><span><strong><span><strong><span>The first is to run advanced SHIC workshops (called </span><span>Next Level SHIC</span><span>) locally for high-potential students throughout the schools SHIC visits. These workshops would be generally more free-form and we will be prepared to provide content and resources specific to the particular students in the workshop. Our goal is to build a local self-sustaining community of young people that will allow them to remain engaged throughout high school and university.</span></strong></span></strong></span></strong></strong></li>\n<li><strong><strong><span><strong><span><strong><span><strong><span>The second is to offer high-potential students one-on-one coaching in order to create a lasting dialogue and increase the chances for significant future impact. This is likely to involve recommending resources that deepen the student&#x2019;s knowledge, and could include information about potential career paths, choosing charities for school fundraisers, or the use of rationality and productivity tools.</span></strong></span></strong></span></strong></span></strong></strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong><strong><span><strong><span><strong><span><strong><span><strong><span>Key metrics for both coaching and advanced workshops will be the number of students we engage through these methods, and the actions students take as a result of their involvement, such as education and career decisions, pursuing volunteering opportunities with effective charities, and attending EA meetups and conferences.</span></strong></span></strong></span></strong></span></strong></span></strong></strong></p>\n<p><strong><span>In 2019, pending analysis of data to be gathered in Autumn 2018, we hope to expand SHIC workshops into one or more additional cities beyond Vancouver.</span></strong></p>\n<p><strong><span><strong><span>Other changes we are making for Autumn 2018:<br><br></span></strong></span></strong><strong></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><span><strong><span><strong><span>We are now placing less emphasis on the future collection of quantitative survey data during the workshop, as this data doesn&#x2019;t appear to properly reflect our impact for reasons outlined in the &#x2018;Quantitative Survey Data&#x2019; Section <a href=\"#quant\">above</a>. </span></strong></span></strong></span></strong><strong><span>As a result we are now administering a shortened post-workshop survey with qualitative questions after all workshops, and omitting the pre-survey.</span></strong></li>\n<li><strong><span><strong><span>We are in the process of creating a more mathematically dense workshop which we have started advertising to Grade 11 and 12 Calculus and Statistics teachers, and have had a promising number of responses coming from teachers already. This should allow us to reach students that we may not have been able to reach so far.</span></strong></span></strong></li>\n<li><strong><span><strong><span><strong><span>SHIC intends to test out methods of engaging tertiary students through guest lectures and workshops in relevant student clubs. We think connecting with tertiary students could be very effective, however we currently do not know how easy it will be to get an audience in this way.</span></strong></span></strong></span></strong></li>\n<li><strong><span><strong><span><strong><span><strong><span>Students around the world will continue to be supported in running the SHIC program as part of a student organization. Despite the high attrition rate of student leaders, the few that are successful are sometimes profoundly affected by the program. These few students may make the Student Leader model worthwhile. For the 2018-19 school year, most of the recruitment and one on one support will be provided by SHIC&#x2019;s volunteer team with staff oversight.</span></strong></span></strong></span></strong></span></strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong><span><strong><span><strong><span><strong><span><br></span></strong></span></strong></span></strong></span></strong><strong><span><strong><span><strong><span><strong><span><strong><span>This post was written by Baxter Bullock, with sections written by Catherine Low and David Moss.

In this article, I discuss why I think that lobbying for stricter baitfish regulations in the U.S. can be an effective intervention.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Scale</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>1 to 10 billion farmed baitfish are sold in the U.S. annually. For comparison, U.S. meat consumption is responsible for the slaughtering of <a href=\"https://animalcharityevaluators.org/research/dietary-impacts/fish-consumption/\">1.3 to 2.5 billion farmed fish</a> and <a href=\"http://www.countinganimals.com/how-many-animals-does-a-vegetarian-save/\">~7.7 billion land vertebrates</a> annually.</li>\n<li>Farmed baitfish suffer not only during farming, but also when transported and kept by wholesalers, retailers, and fishermen, where conditions may be worse. They also suffer <a href=\"http://www.fishpain.com/fish-and-pain-live-bait.htm\">during angling</a>.</li>\n<li>Most farmed baitfish are sold when they are about 1 year old.[1]</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Neglectedness</strong>:</p>\n<p>I was able to find very little evidence of animal activism directed towards stricter baitfish laws. The issue seems to be very neglected.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Tractability</strong>:</p>\n<p>Live baitfish use is prohibited in some parts of Europe, Canada and the U.S. due to concerns about invasive species, spread of diseases, and animal rights. This is an indication that lobbying for stricter regulations could be tractable.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Counterfactuals</strong>:</p>\n<p>If the use of live baitfish was prohibited, some anglers would likely use artificial baits instead, but some would choose to use worms, leeches, or other animals as live bait.</p>\n<h2>Number of baitfish raised in the U.S.</h2>\n<p>Different sources seem to provide somewhat conflicting numbers about the number of baitfish that are sold and produced annually. They range from 1 billion to over 10 billion:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>According to the USDA\u2019s Census of Aquaculture, over <a href=\"https://www.agcensus.usda.gov/Publications/2012/Online_Resources/Aquaculture/aqua_1_004_005.pdf\">1.17 billion baitfish</a> were sold in the U.S. in 2013.</li>\n<li>One Arkansas farm <a href=\"http://www.andersonminnows.com/species3.php\">boasts</a> of hatching (or \u201c<a href=\"http://www.andersonminnows.com/index.php\">be capable of producing</a>\u201d) 1 billion golden shriners annually. This seems to contradict the Census of Aquaculture, which claims that 523 million golden shiners were produced in the whole U.S. in 2013.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/4pk7ex4qud9bkqb/BaitfishCultureinArkansas%20December1997.pdf?dl=0\">Stone et al. (1997)</a> claim that Arkansas alone is producing over six billion baitfish annually.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1577/1548-8446(2004)29[19:TOEFV]2.0.CO;2\">Goodwin et al. (2004)</a> claim that \u201cMore than 80% of all baitfish are farm raised, but there is a very significant trade in wild-caught fish (Stone et al. 1997). The baitfish industry ships more than 10 billion fish per year.\u201d Since it\u2019s citing the article in the point above, I\u2019m guessing that the 10 billion figure is just an extrapolation of the 6 billion figure for the whole U.S.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I haven\u2019t found any articles citing The Census of Aquaculture figure which makes me doubt its accuracy. The six billion figure for Arkansas from Stone et al. 1997 is widely cited. However, it could be outdated, especially since the industry seems to be on the decline.</p>\n\n<p>Conflicting figures are partly explained by <a href=\"https://www.ncrac.org/files/biblio/baitfish32900.pdf\">Gunderson and Tucker (2000)</a>:</p>\n<p>\u201cCurrent and accurate estimates of production and value of baitfish in the U.S. and the NCR are not available. The lack of accurate production estimates is the result of inconsistencies in reporting, different methods of reporting (i.e., gallons, dozens, pounds), use of different common names for the same species across the region, and difficulty in separating cultured baitfish from wild harvested baitfish.\u201d</p>\n<p>Gunderson and Tucker (2000) also claim that there are discrepancies between the 1998 Census of Aquaculture and other surveys because the census did not define aquaculture products. Later censuses defined aquaculture products more clearly but their definition might have differed from definitions in other surveys.</p>\n\n<p>Another explanation for seemingly conflicting figures is that the number of baitfish that are sold can differ from the number of baitfish that are hatched/produced due to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Mortality in farms. <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/book/10.1002/9781118329443\">Mischke (2012), p. 223</a> suggests that baitfish may have a mortality rate of ~25% (\u201cfrom fry to juvenile\u201d).</li>\n<li>Not selling all the fish. <a href=\"https://cals.arizona.edu/azaqua/extension/National/Abstracts.pdf\">Stone (2003)</a> claims that \u201cmarketing and distribution networks are critical to the success of a baitfish farm, and in most years many more pounds of fish are raised than can be sold.\u201d[2]</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When it comes to the number of individuals, the baitfish industry is comparable to the foodfish industry. U.S. food consumption is responsible for farming of <a href=\"https://animalcharityevaluators.org/research/dietary-impacts/fish-consumption/\">3.9\u20137.8 fish</a> per year per capita, excluding shellfish. 1\u201310 billion baitfish produced annually translates to 3-31 baitfish produced per year per capita. However, food fish tend to be much bigger and raising them usually takes slightly more time.</p>\n<h2>The industry seems to be on the decline</h2>\n<p>Looking at data from <a href=\"https://www.st.nmfs.noaa.gov/st1/publications.html\">Fisheries of the United States reports</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.agcensus.usda.gov/Publications/2012/Online_Resources/Aquaculture/aqua_1_016_016.pdf\">2013 Census of Aquaculture</a>, the baitfish farming industry seems to be on the decline:</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1667995697/mirroredImages/gGiiktK69R2YY7FfG/zzf21sw6cptqwfvjrmee.png\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/ilHPVxq.png\"></p>\n\n<p>This observation is based on the same government data that was criticised by <a href=\"https://www.ncrac.org/files/biblio/baitfish32900.pdf\">Gunderson and Tucker (2000)</a>, so it\u2019s unclear how much it can be trusted. It\u2019s also unclear whether all the censuses collected data in a consistent way. For example, 2005 included 335 million feeder goldfish into baitfish calculations but the 2013 census did not. According to Gunderson and Tucker (2000), \u201csome goldfish enter the baitfish market, but a large part of the production is used for feeding aquarium and pond fish and do not constitute baitfish production.\u201c</p>\n\n<p>Reasons for the presumed decline are unclear. One possible reason is the increasing burden regulations (see <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jwas.12416\">Senten and Engle (2017)</a> and <a href=\"https://www.outdoornews.com/2018/03/19/shops-closure-42-years-leaves-baitfish-void/\">Hilts (2018)</a>). <a href=\"https://www.bait-up.com\">bait-up.com</a> claims that baitfish \"are used less and less by anglers for three simple reasons. First, it is becoming more difficult to find bait shops who carry minnows. Second, there is additional time required to keep them alive before and during your fishing trip and third most live bait storage containers are hard to use efficiently while fishing.\"</p>\n\n<p>If the baitfish industry really is on the decline, it decreases the importance of the cause. However, it may also increase tractability. The involvement of animal rights groups may be the final push that causes the industry to collapse or prevents it from recovering. It may also prevent implementing <a href=\"https://www.flseagrant.org/wp-content/uploads/sgeb69_growing_marine_baitfish.pdf\">plans to increase the scale of saltwater baitfish aquaculture</a> (currently most of the farmed baitfish are used for freshwater fishing).</p>\n<h2>Monetary value</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1577/1548-8446(1993)018%3C0006%3AEOFBUI%3E2.0.CO%3B2\">Litvak and Mandrak (1993)</a> conservatively estimated the retail value of baitfish sold in Canada and the United States (both farm-raised and wild-caught) to be $1 billion annually. </li>\n<li>According to government data, the total value of farmed baitfish sold in the U.S. was <a href=\"https://www.st.nmfs.noaa.gov/Assets/commercial/fus/fus95/ld-aquc.pdf\">63 million in 1993</a> and <a href=\"https://www.agcensus.usda.gov/Publications/2012/Online_Resources/Aquaculture/aqua_1_004_005.pdf\">29 million in 2013</a>. As I understand, U.S. government figures are lower than Litvak and Mandrak (1993) partly because they are calculating the value of fish sold by farms rather than retail value, and they exclude Canada where wild-caught baitfish is sold. </li>\n<li>Baitfish are cheap per individual, especially at wholesale price. <a href=\"https://www.agcensus.usda.gov/Publications/2012/Online_Resources/Aquaculture/aqua_1_004_005.pdf\">$1 can purchase 9 to 63 fish</a>, depending on the species.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Other countries</h2>\n<p>I have found very little information about baitfish farming for recreational fishing outside of the U.S. <a href=\"https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=5uurTfpWRH0C&amp;pg=PA67&amp;lpg=PA67&amp;dq=billion+baitfish&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=clMx63Bxu3&amp;sig=TIzqQuHaf-l4AWJZcoNQVf-5JUc&amp;hl=lt&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiyk7K1k7DcAhXMmOAKHauhBv4Q6AEwBnoECAYQAQ#v=snippet&amp;q=%22Fish%20and%20crustaceans%20are%20raised%20and%20sold%20as%20bait%20all%20over%20the%20world.%22&amp;f=false\">Carole and Kwamena (2008)</a> claim:</p>\n<p>\u201cFish and crustaceans are raised and sold as bait all over the world. However, baitfish production in most countries is either small scale, incidental, or simply serves to sell fish that are too small to meet foodfish market requirements. However, the U.S. baitfish industry provides an example of baitfish production that has been developed into a large and important industry\u201d</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/326000426_Endoparasites_of_Gymnotus_sp_Gymnotiformes_Gymnotidae_from_commercial_baitfish_farming_in_Pantanal_basin_Central_Brazil\">Ventura et al. (2017)</a> show that baitfish are also farmed for recreational fishing in Brazil.</p>\n<h2>Existing regulations</h2>\n<p>Using fish as live bait is already prohibited in some U.S. and Canadian states. Many other states have import and movement restrictions. An overview can be seen in <a href=\"https://www.ontario.ca/page/bait-management-review#section-7\">Kerr (2012)</a>. More detailed information about laws in each state can be found in <a href=\"https://www.ontario.ca/page/bait-management-review#section-14\">this table</a>.</p>\n\n<p>In Scotland, it is <a href=\"http://fms.scot/legislation/\">prohibited to use any live vertebrate as bait.</a> Some of the discussion leading to the prohibition can be found <a href=\"http://pacnews.blogspot.com/2007/03/livebaiting-is-banned-in-scotland.html\">here</a> and <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1538745/Anglers-fear-ban-on-cruel-live-bait-will-spread.html\">here</a>. Switzerland <a href=\"http://www.baselinenglish.ch/all-rules-and-regulations-for-switzerland/1345-2/\">seems to have</a> a similar regulation. In <a href=\"http://fishinglicence.eu/poland\">Poland</a>, <a href=\"http://pacnews.blogspot.com/2007/03/livebaiting-is-banned-in-scotland.html\">Denmark</a>, and the rest of the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/freshwater-rod-fishing-rules/tackle-you-can-use\">UK</a>, it is only allowed to use baitfish that is caught in the same waters it is used. As I understand, this practically eliminates the possibility of a baitfish farming industry.</p>\n<h2>What has been done</h2>\n<p>It seems that the main motivation for existing restrictions is preventing the transfer of fish species and diseases between water bodies, rather than animal cruelty. Overall, I was able to find very little information about any animal rights activists fighting for stricter baitfish laws:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1538745/Anglers-fear-ban-on-cruel-live-bait-will-spread.html\">This article</a> claims that the ban in Scotland was a \"massive first step\" in PETA\u2019s fight for prohibiting live bait in the rest of Britain. I haven\u2019t been able to find what PETA did though.[3]</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20160707041821/https://www.theblackfish.org/news/joining-forces-for-the-fish\">This page</a> describes another campaign in the UK.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I haven\u2019t found any indication of activism in the U.S. <a href=\"https://www.ncrac.org/files/biblio/baitfish32900.pdf\">Gunderson and Tucker (2000)</a> claims:</p>\n<p>\u201cApparently in Europe, because of strong animal rights sentiments, the use of live fish for angling has been eliminated or severely restricted in some areas. The impact of the animal rights movement on the future of baitfish aquaculture in the U.S. is not predictable, but it could present problems for fish farmers in the future\u201d</p>\n<h2>Next steps</h2>\n<p>Based on my investigation, I think that an intervention in this area could be effective. I would like to know whether or not other people agree. I am also unsure how to proceed if we were to conclude that it was a promising opportunity. Maybe with some lobbying the outcomes of some baitfish-related policy disputes (like <a href=\"http://www.startribune.com/bait-dealers-want-to-import-golden-shiners-dnr-says-that-s-too-risky/418282263/\">this one</a>) could influenced. However, I don\u2019t have resources or expertise to do anything about it myself. I thought I could send this text to some U.S. animal charities and ask if they would be interested in pursuing the opportunity. Suggestions about what to do would be welcome. </p>\n\n<p>If some action were taken, I think we should be sensitive to the fact that the baitfish industry is the source of livelihood for many well-meaning people.</p>\n<h2>Notes</h2>\n<p>[1]&nbsp;The most popular baitfish are golden shiners and fathead minnows. <a href=\"https://www.leg.state.mn.us/docs/2018/mandated/180238.pdf\">Gunderson (2018)</a> claims that most golden shiners are sold when they are 1 year old, some earlier, some when they are 1.5 years old (page 7). Based on fathead minnow aquaculture description in <a href=\"https://www.ncrac.org/files/biblio/baitfish32900.pdf\">Gunderson and Tucker (2000)</a>, it seems that most fathead minnows are sold when they are about 1 year old as well (page 7).</p>\n\n<p>[2]&nbsp;Similarly, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amnjic-EJzg&amp;t=1545s\">this documentary</a> claims that \u201cbaitfish sales can fluctuate wildly\u201d and that \u201cthe weather on four or five weekends in the spring can determine the profitability of the baitfish operation for the entire year.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>[3]&nbsp;The article cites PETA\u2019s employee Yvonne Taylor.

Because of this, their interests are poorly represented in current political systems. This post summarizes some work we have done in EA Sweden to better represent future generations in the Swedish political system. The idea is to find ways in which the political system can be tweaked or affected to better take the interests of future generations into account. This can be done by things such as: making adjustments to the legislative process, setting up an Ombudsman for future generations, giving rights to future generations or having a Minister for the future in government.</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>The idea is based on and inspired by work that has been done primarily in the UK starting in 2017 by among others FUSE (Future of Sentience, now a part of Effective Altruism: Cambridge) and CSER (Centre for the Study of Existential Risks), which for example lead to the formation of the <a href=\"https://www.appgfuturegenerations.com/\">All-Party Parliamentary Group on Future Generations</a> in November 2017</span><span>. The group consists of MPs interested in issues related to future generations, has a secretariat hosted by CSER and e.g. puts on seminars highlighting specific global catastrophic risks. </span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>So what have we been up to? Following a similar project plan to the UK group, we have done research looking at different methods to giving representation to future generations in countries around the world, e.g. by setting up Ombudsmen, granting rights to future people and having committees in the legislature tasked with protecting the interests of future people. We have also researched the Swedish context, including interviews with over 20 relevant stakeholders. Based on the above, we&apos;ve decided on a number of recommendations, which we are currently doing work to implement.</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>Below, we&#x2019;ll describe the rationale behind the project, the progress we&#x2019;ve made so far, a brief description of the results of our research (full write-up </span><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1O5SYeJF-WbilQcqeJ8TFk7fHgSkVoQ3CPTTSlMj3W9Q/edit?usp=sharing\"><span>here</span></a><span>), our plans going forward and some advice to other groups interested in doing similar work. </span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<h2>Contents</h2>\n<p><span><span>1.

Should other groups try to do the same thing?</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span>6. Kudos</span></span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<h2>1. Project rationale</h2>\n<p><span>There is a large emphasis on basic research in the global catastrophic risk-space, with e.g. </span><a href=\"http://allfed.info/\"><span>ALLFED</span></a><span> being a notable exception. This is plausibly a good strategy in a space where we have little knowledge about what policies will make a difference and being wary that some of them might even be harmful. However, as we find out more about how to counteract global catastrophic risks, there needs to be a way for the research to affect the behaviour of relevant actors. So far, this has mainly been done by raising awareness among those who are likely to develop the potentially harmful technology &#x2013; i.e. researchers and companies. Another approach, aimed at in this project, is finding ways for the research to affect policy. In particular, there is a lot of value to capacity-building in this area: laying the groundworks to be able to affect policy further down the line. Given the above, a project of this kind could have several benefits: </span><span>direct impact</span><span> by positively affecting policy, </span><span>capacity building</span><span> by developing networks and skills in the area, in addition to </span><span>exploration value</span><span> by learning more about how to have effective altruism and research on global catastrophic risks affect policy.</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>Projects of this sort come with risks of actual harm that one should be wary of. Firstly, the project could be directly harmful if it caused harmful policies to be put in place. This could e.g. happen given high degrees of uncertainty about what policies will decrease existential risk. Secondly, a project of this kind could have negative reputational effects. If carried out poorly, effective altruism or work on global catastrophic risks could come to be viewed negatively by important stakeholders such as politicians. In short, it could lead to worse opportunities to positively affect policy.</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>In short, the rationale for going ahead with the project was firstly that it seemed plausibly valuable, especially in terms of exploration value and capacity building. Secondly, we thought that we had the resources to carry it out, both in terms of committed members and in terms of connections to organisations and individuals. Many x-risk researchers are Swedish (e.g. Anders Sandberg, Max Tegmark, Nick Bostrom and Olle H&#xE4;ggstr&#xF6;m) and there are at least two Swedish organisations working actively with global catastrophic risks willing to support us with advice, expertise and networks: the Institute for Future Studies and the Global Challenges Foundation. Thirdly, the reputational and brand risks to the effective altruism movement in engaging with politics are likely less severe in a small country (only ~10 million inhabitants) where English is not the first language.</span></p>\n<p><strong>&#xA0;</strong></p>\n<h2>2. Progress so far</h2>\n<p><span>Since starting the project in January, some of the main things we have done are:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span>Researching what ways of representing future generations are suitable in a Swedish context, looking at e.g. how future generations have been given representation in other countries and previous attempts to do so in Sweden. Based on research and interviews with dozens of stakeholders, ranging from politicians, to researchers and campaigners. See the abstract of the write-up of this work below and the write-up itself </span><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1O5SYeJF-WbilQcqeJ8TFk7fHgSkVoQ3CPTTSlMj3W9Q/edit?usp=sharing\"><span>here</span></a><span>. </span></li>\n<li><span>Found and acted on an opportunity to do object-level work, publishing </span><a href=\"https://www.dagenssamhalle.se/debatt/forbjud-dodliga-autonoma-vapensystem-21566\"><span>this article</span></a><span> &#x2013; with Anders Sandberg, Carin Ism, Max Tegmark and Olle H&#xE4;ggstr&#xF6;m &#x2013; in a Swedish newspaper arguing for a lethal autonomous weapons-ban when we saw that there would be a vote on the topic in Parliament. </span></li>\n<li><span>Started work to communicate and implement our proposed changes. This has been done by putting on a launch event, organising and participating in seminars, writing an </span><a href=\"https://www.dn.se/debatt/sa-kan-politiker-tvingas-ta-hansyn-till-framtida-generationer/\"><span>opinion piece</span></a><span> about our recommendations in one of Sweden&#x2019;s main newspapers, and reaching out to and meeting with members of the Swedish Parliament.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>&#xA0;</strong></p>\n<h2>3. Summary of our write-up</h2>\n<p><span>Below, we&#x2019;ve cut out some relevant parts of the write-up: criteria used for deciding on what institutional changes to recommend and our recommendations. For details about what has been tried in other countries, a list of all the different changes we considered and a history of these kinds of institutional tweaks in Sweden, have a look at sections 4-6 of <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1O5SYeJF-WbilQcqeJ8TFk7fHgSkVoQ3CPTTSlMj3W9Q/edit?usp=sharing\">our write-up</a>. </span></p>\n<p><strong>&#xA0;</strong></p>\n<h3>3.1. Criteria for suitable institutional tweaks</h3>\n<p><span>When thinking about what changes to the legislative system to recommend, we have taken the following criteria into account.</span></p>\n<p><strong>&#xA0;</strong></p>\n<p><span>Achievability</span></p>\n<p><span>Achievability concerns the likelihood that a system is successfully established. Institutions and mechanisms that are difficult to implement are less likely to be established than those that are more easy to implement. Difficulties can manifest themselves as complicated legislative changes (e.g. changes to the constitution) that require a lot of political support over time to be implemented, or costly initiatives that demand that resources be transferred from already established institutions to new ones. Establishing a new institution can create a lot of opposition from already existing institutions, because they may fear that their resources or mandate are threatened.</span></p>\n<p><strong>&#xA0;</strong></p>\n<p><span>Sustainability</span></p>\n<p><span>Apart from being established, a system must be maintained in order to be able to have beneficial effects on policy-making. Sustainability is the property to remain operational over time. In order for institutions and other mechanisms of a system to be sustainable, wide support, both publicly and across the political spectrum, or constitutional entrenchment, are important factors. </span></p>\n<p><strong>&#xA0;</strong></p>\n<p><span>Important factors to consider are whether the institution manages to create support for itself or if it might cause its own destruction (Caney 2016). Further, legitimacy, and power in proportion to perceived legitimacy, are important factors. Institutions that have received much power early on have not lasted long, suggesting that soft-power mechanisms are preferable, at least initially.</span></p>\n<p><strong>&#xA0;</strong></p>\n<p><span>Effectiveness </span></p>\n<p><span>Achievability and sustainability are necessary conditions for a system to be able to have any effect on policy over time, but they are far from sufficient. Once they are in place, it is crucial that the system is effective, that is, that it affects policy positively. </span>In order for a system to be effective, it must have the power to influence policy. This power may have been formally delegated to an institution (e.g. the power to veto new legislation) or may be have been obtained informally (e.g. by the media).</p>\n<p><strong>&#xA0;</strong></p>\n<p><span>To ensure effectiveness, the proposed system should address the causes of political short-termism. Such causes include </span><span>ignorance of the future</span><span>, </span><span>electoral and economic dependence</span><span>, </span><span>type of performance indicators and auditing duration</span><span>, and </span><span>media coverage</span><span>. Short time-frames within these areas tend to spill over and make politics short-sighted as well. In addition, there are several aspects of human nature that causes us to be biased in policy-making. For instance, we often </span><span>fail to detect creeping problems</span><span>, we are </span><span>more likely to take action if a victim is identifiable</span><span>, we </span><span>respond more to vivid risks and tend to ignore things that are not in front of us</span><span>, and we tend to be </span><span>prone to positive illusions</span><span>. In addition, we have a tendency </span><span>to procrastinate</span><span> and may </span><span>fall for temptation, weakness of will or self-interest</span><span> (Caney 2016, in <a href=\"https://global.oup.com/academic/product/institutions-for-future-generations-9780198746959?cc=se&amp;lang=en&amp;\"><em>Institutions for Future Generations</em></a>). A system that aims to represent future generations should include mechanisms that corrects for these causes of short-termism. </span></p>\n<p><strong>&#xA0;</strong></p>\n<p><span>Access to necessary resources</span></p>\n<p><span>In addition, for a system to deliver beneficial policy, it must have access to necessary resources. This includes sufficient funding as well as relevant information and expertise. In order to create beneficial policy, different policy-areas must be sufficiently understood, which makes access to subject-matter experts and high-quality research essential. Given the low maturity of research into GCRs, this criteria becomes particularly important to us.</span><span> This access could be obtained by empowering a specific institution to carry out and collate relevant research. Further, it is important that new policy is able to respond to changes and is made relevant. To facilitate this, it is important that the system is transparent and allows input from all stakeholders to be taken into consideration. </span></p>\n<p><strong>&#xA0;</strong></p>\n<h3>3.2. Recommendations</h3>\n<p>The initiatives we propose are presented below, each followed by a brief explanation. The recommendation is not that one initiative be implemented&#xA0;before the next one is started. Rather, we would expect that several recommendations be&#xA0;pursued&#xA0;in parallel.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><strong>A. Ensure that there are sufficient means to implement and achieve the Climate Act and Agenda 2030 (the Sustainable Development Goals)</strong></p>\n<p>To achieve the ambitious goals, leadership from government, parliamentary anchoring and concrete actions are required. To support this, we propose a Future Commission in the Swedish Parliament (Riksdag), whose first task is to monitor the implementation of both the Climate Act and Agenda 2030. The hope would be that the body would be used going forward doing other work as well.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p>This proposal seems like it can be impactful by supporting the implementation of the Swedish Climate Act and Agenda 2030. However, we also think it is a good proposal even if one is primarily concerned with GCRs. This is because such a Future Commission could potentially be used to put technological risks on the political agenda, and because it allows us to get support from a wider range of stakeholders who are more interested in Agenda 2030 and climate change than technological risks.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><strong>B. Establish an Ombudsman for future generations</strong></p>\n<p>The Children&apos;s Ombudsman was established because children lack the opportunity to protect their own interests. The same applies to future generations. An Ombudsman for future generations is needed to monitor the work of government, parliament and all authorities to take into account the interests of future generations and to propose new legislation that protects their interests.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p>A State Ombudsman for Future Generations would help ensure that the interests of future generations are properly taken into consideration, both in the legislative process and when it comes to implementing and enforcing new policy. The role of the Ombudsman would be to investigate, present opinions, and propose legislation, not deliver binding rulings, which makes it a soft power institution. In carrying out its work, the Ombudsman would help with continuous agenda-setting, thereby helping the system to become self-sustaining.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p>An Ombudsman needs a legal base to work from. Such a base could be made up of international treaties or conventions, legally recognized rights of future generations, or other legislation aimed at protecting future generations (Beckman &amp; Uggla 2016). We are currently unsure about the strength of the mandate required and whether mandates with this strength currently exist in Sweden. The Sustainable Development Goals might form such a basis. Another candidate is the Swedish constitution which holds that &#x201C;the public institutions shall promote sustainable development leading to a good environment for present and future generations&#x201D; (<a href=\"https://www.riksdagen.se/globalassets/07.-dokument--lagar/the-constitution-of-sweden-160628.pdf\">The Constitution of Sweden</a>, Ch. 1, &#xA7;2). We expect to become clearer on this point over time.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p>In general, we think the argument in favour of an Ombudsman for future generations has public appeal, mainly since the rhetoric seems effective and because people have a good understanding of the function of Ombudsmen. It is therefore easy to campaign on. Furthermore, we think that an Ombudsman would be beneficial in implementing policy related to future generations. However, creating a new Ombudsman is likely politically difficult. They tend to last for a long time, but seldom be created. All in all, the Ombudsman scores low on achievability, but high on sustainability, effectiveness and access to knowledge.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><strong>C. Create a cross-political network for future generations in the Swedish Parliament</strong></p>\n<p>To move important future issues onto the political agenda, we propose that a cross-political network is established. Such a network would help create wide political support, which is key for both the achievability and sustainability of other institutions and mechanisms that we recommend should be developed and established later. It would also have positive ongoing impact on agenda-setting, aiding in ensuring that future issues remain a relevant topic of consideration.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p>Cross-political networks are not regulated by law and can take different forms. Some are organisations with their own statutes and internal rules, whereas others are more loosely arranged. What unites them is that their members come from different political parties. This means that there is a lot of freedom when it comes to establishing such a network, which leaves it open to us to consider what kind of role we want to have. Based on our interviews, these networks are common, but since they are not regulated it is difficult to know how many there are, what they do and what impact they have.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p>In the United Kingdom, a cross-political network &#x2013; the <a href=\"https://www.appgfuturegenerations.com/\">All-Party Parliamentary Group on Future Generations</a> &#x2013; has been up and running since the fall of 2017. From what we have heard, that group is doing well. It has, however, been pointed out to us that there is a difference in the amount of power that the parliamentarians in the United Kingdom have compared to the parliamentarians in Sweden. But since it is up to the networks how they are organised and how they operate, we feel that a cross-political network is a good way to have impact at a low cost.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p>Further, we propose that the Institute for Future Studies takes on increasing responsibilities with regard to future issues, and take on a role similar to CSER in regard to the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Future Generations. The institute already carries out research on future issues. With increasing resources it could take on a broader role and serve as a think tank to the parliament, carrying out and collating research on a wide variety of future issues. We also think that it would be valuable if the institute could become a permanent body considering proposed legislation.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p>In summary, a cross-political network seems to score high on achievability, medium on effectiveness and access to knowledge, and potentially low on sustainability.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><strong>D. Increase the focus on future issues throughout the legislative process</strong></p>\n<p>Throughout the legislative process, consideration should be given to the effect new legislation has on future generations. This can be done e.g. by requiring committees to take into account the interests of future generations when certain kinds of decisions are made or in other ways amending the procedures of parliamentary committees. We think doing so could be impactful, since it would mainstream thinking about future generations. However, determining what changes are appropriate is very difficult, given the complexity of the legislative process and the constraints (mainly in terms of time in the Swedish context) of parliamentary committees. This can be done by requiring that the investigation (utredning) that precedes a new law takes a future perspective and evaluates the consequences for future generations of the issue at hand, by establishing a new body to routinely review proposed legislation (remissinstans) with regard to the interests of future generations, or by requiring that the interests of future generations be taken into account in all reports from the parliamentary committees (utskottsbet&#xE4;nkanden).</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><strong>E. Support from civil society</strong></p>\n<p>Politicians need support from citizens who want politicians to take responsibility for long-term challenges. We need to show support not only for political promises to take certain actions, but also for the implementation that follows from such promises.</p>\n<p><strong>&#xA0;</strong></p>\n<p>We believe that there is a gap that we can fill here. There are discussions about policy issues that quite closely align with the cause areas or issues that long-termist effective altruists might be particularly interested in that are currently not pushed for by civil society.&#xA0;For example, noticing that a ban on lethal autonomous weapons was being voted on in the Parliament, we could with quite small means write <a href=\"https://www.dagenssamhalle.se/debatt/forbjud-dodliga-autonoma-vapensystem-21566\">an article for Dagens Samh&#xE4;lle </a>one of the more wonky Swedish newspapers with Max Tegmark (FLI), Carin Ism (Global Challenges Foundation), Anders Sandberg (FHI) and Olle H&#xE4;ggstr&#xF6;m (Chalmers Technical University). We will likely keep doing similar things in the future.</p>\n<p><strong>&#xA0;</strong></p>\n<h2>4. Plans going forward</h2>\n<p><span>Going forward, we are planning to: </span></p>\n<p>Keep pushing our message&#xA0;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Continue finding MPs that are sympathetic to our cause and that potentially could become part of a cross-political network.</li>\n<li>Hold seminars and host events (e.g. a debate about the future with relevant youth politicians).</li>\n<li>Get noticed more in the media (e.g. continue to publish in the big newspapers).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Put ourselves in a better position to do more good in the future</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Build a coalition with important actors (organisations and individuals) to ensure that this becomes more than an effective altruism project. We don&apos;t think we&apos;ll be able to succeed in this campaign alone.</li>\n<li>Collect signatures, e.g. from public figures.</li>\n<li>Attract more people to the project core team to increase capacity (focusing on recruiting for specific roles).&#xA0;</li>\n<li>Update our communications and messaging strategies, along with our brand (mainly visual).&#xA0;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Constantly evaluating our work to find ways to improve</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Set specific goals against which our progress can be evaluated.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>&#xA0;</strong></p>\n<h2>5. Should other groups try to do the same thing?</h2>\n<p><span>Before carrying out your own project of this sort, there&#x2019;s a number of factors to consider. Firstly, there&#x2019;s been quite a bit of discussion recently about the usefulness of direct work among local groups (e.g. <a href=\"/ea/1p7/a_concrete_model_for_running_an_ea_group/\">here</a>, <a href=\"/ea/1ow/why_groups_should_consider_direct_work/\">here</a> and <a href=\"https://app.effectivealtruism.org/groups/resources/effective-altruism-community-building\">here</a>)</span><span>. Secondly, there are the risks mentioned above that need to be taken into account. </span></p>\n<p><strong>&#xA0;</strong></p>\n<p><span>In summary, if you&#x2019;re considering embarking on a similar project, we would give the following advice:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Don&#x2019;t get started without talking to experts within relevant communities</em><span> (e.g. x-risk researchers and people at effective altruist organizations). Carrying out a project like this, and especially reaching out to politicians, could turn out to be harmful. </span></li>\n<li><em>Make sure you have the capacity to carry out the project</em><span>. This includes having a group of people capable of carrying out the project (e.g. with strong social skills, project management, understanding of the issues and good judgment), having access to experts (much like the project in the UK would have been difficult to carry out without this, ours would have been difficult without access to e.g. the Institute for Future Studies) and having political connections. </span></li>\n<li><em>Conduct cheap tests</em><span>. If we were to do the project again, for example, it may have been a good first step to gauge the interest among MPs more before getting started.</span></li>\n<li><em>Local context is really important</em><span>. Though there seems to be some generalisable conclusions &#x2013; e.g. that being adversarial often proves counterproductive &#x2013; local context will have a large impact. We think we underestimated the importance of the local context.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>&#xA0;</strong></p>\n<h2>6.

This post will go into detail on our plans for further deepening the value the EA Funds provide to the EA community, identify mistakes we have made along the way and provide a general update on our thinking regarding the future of EA Funds.</p>\n<h1>Initial Context</h1>\n<p>EA Funds was built during the early months of 2017, during CEA&#x2019;s time as a participant in the Y Combinator startup accelerator. The platform was built as a means to facilitate donations in the EA community. This was built up from (amongst other things) experience with the Giving What We Can Trust, which performed a similar role, but which lacked some of EA Funds&#x2019; key features, and had a smaller subset of possible grantees.</p>\n<p>In particular, we were motivated by the idea that people often set up their donations on an ongoing, recurring basis (which is good, because it removes <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/reitXJgJXFzKpdKyd/beware-trivial-inconveniences\">trivial inconveniences</a> &#xA0;to donating), but don&#x2019;t often review them. We were also interested in increasing specialization of donation decisions, such that a smaller number of more expert people could decide the best ways to spend money, rather than everyone duplicating the effort of in-depth research.</p>\n<p>To a large extent, this has been very successful. To date we have regranted (or are currently in the process of regranting) more than $5 million of EA-aligned money to around 50 organizations. We&#x2019;ve been able to extend the platform to provide additional payment-related services (for example, the donor lottery run at the beginning of the year), and &#x2013; in the wake of the crypto boom at the end of 2017 &#x2013; made it straightforward for donors to donate large cryptocurrency windfalls tax-efficiently.</p>\n<p>However, the project has always existed alongside other CEA projects, and earlier in 2018 (and given the platform had been operating stably for close to a year), we made the choice to deprioritize active work on EA Funds in favour of devoting more staff resources to other projects (where active work includes technical work to improve the user experience, operations work to e.g. bring on new grantee organizations or to check in on a regular basis with Fund managers). EA Funds has been operational and has been making regrants for the entire period, but it hasn&#x2019;t been the primary focus of our technical or operations staff.</p>\n<p>Our intention has always been to come back to EA Funds, and when we made the choice to prioritize other projects in Q1, we expected to that this would happen later in the year. Furthermore, at the most recent CEA team retreat (mid-June), we reviewed how EA Funds was operating, and decided that we were ready to re-commence work on the platform in order to ensure that it remained a trusted and reliable donation option. As such, we made the choice that we would begin again in earnest to make some overdue improvements to the operation of the platform, and have been doing so since the beginning of Q3. In other words, we&#x2019;ve been aware of the same problems that have recently been raised in community discussion and working on appropriate solutions.</p>\n<p>We regret not communicating about this situation more openly, and in retrospect recognize that waiting until we have resolved all the issues and had more concrete, positive announcements to make has led to a situation where some in the community began developing reservations about how the platform was being run. We plan to be more open about what we are working on with the platform going forward.</p>\n<h3>Requested improvements</h3>\n<p>The two main things that community members have asked for during the period EA Funds has been operating have been:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Easy visibility of current Fund balances</li>\n<li>A more consistent regranting schedule</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The former is discussed in detail below under the heading Updates to Fund Management, the latter under Operational Updates.</p>\n<p>Other features we&#x2019;re working on at the moment:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Better integration between payroll giving providers and EA Funds (so that soon donations created through a payroll giving provider will be visible in your EA Funds dashboard)</li>\n<li>An automated system to let Fund managers and grantees know their current account balance on a quarterly basis, to prompt more regular regranting</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Updates to Fund management</h1>\n<p>We&#x2019;re currently in the process of finalizing some changes to how the Funds are managed. The most significant announcement is that Nick Beckstead will step down as the manager of the EA Community and Long-Term Future Funds.</p>\n<p>Nick Beckstead has provided the following statement, explaining his reasons for stepping down as a manager of these Funds:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>At the time I drafted my April update, I told CEA that I was interested in stepping down as a manager of the EA Community and Long-Term Future Funds. My reasons are as follows.</p>\n<p>The original premise of me as a fund manager was that I would fund the grants that I wanted to make but couldn&#x2019;t fund through Open Phil, and that this wouldn&#x2019;t require a substantial additional time investment on my part. However, I encountered fewer grantmaking opportunities that I couldn&#x2019;t fund through Open Phil than I expected, partly because Open Phil&#x2019;s funding in these areas grew more quickly than I expected. The main thing I&#x2019;ve wanted to do at Open Phil, but haven&#x2019;t been able to, is to increase the size of my EA and GCR (Global Catastrophic Risks) grants, which is a large part of the reason I made the set of grants that I did. I could in theory have spent additional time sourcing and evaluating other opportunities, but it has generally seemed that additional time would be better spent on grantmaking at Open Phil or other Open Phil work (especially given that other funders who have more time to devote to the effort and currently are working with smaller budgets - such as EA Grants and BERI - were becoming involved in the space).</p>\n<p>Going forward, I believe it will be more impactful and more satisfying to our community to have people managing the EA Community and Long-term Future Funds who can&#x2019;t make most of their grants through other means, and for whom it would make more sense to devote more substantial attention to the management of these funds. I believe this could also be beneficial because it would increase the diversity of perspectives of grantmakers and offer others an opportunity to gain experience and establish larger track records as grantmakers.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Nick and CEA agreed&#xA0;that he would step down from his role as manager of these two Funds after making his final set of grants in July 2018, and in late May 2018 a process for naming his successors was started. Nick has now recommended his final grants, and we are in late stages of the process to name the new managers for these Funds.</p>\n<p>During this process we have been focusing on finding managers that are widely respected in the community, have some experience with funding relevant organisations at moderate scale and are able to commit the time required to making grants about twice a year or more. Given some of the considerations Nick outlines above, we&#x2019;re also planning to experiment with a &#x2018;committee&#x2019; approach, where several individuals may be involved in providing grant recommendations for a particular Fund. We look forward to announcing the new managers to the community in the coming weeks.</p>\n<p>It&#x2019;s worth noting that, notwithstanding the change in Fund manager, and the fact that we expect this to lead towards more regular regrants, we still believe that, as a general rule, grant managers should donate when they see good opportunities, not on the basis of a fixed schedule, as we think that good grants made later are likely to be better than rushed grants (at least for some bounded period of time, after which the effect of discounting would make the grants equally valuable).</p>\n<h1>Operational Updates</h1>\n<p>Over the last few months, we have been working on making improvements to the platform so that the day to day operations run smoothly, transparently and take a reasonable amount of staff time.</p>\n<p>The first visible result of this is an update to the EA Funds website, where each of the four main Funds now has the current balance (as of the end of the previous calendar month) displayed above the list of regrants, taken directly from our accounting system. This will bypass the need for manual updates being posted, and allows everyone access to the latest numbers at all times. If you now view a Fund&#x2019;s page (see e.g.&#xA0; <a href=\"https://app.effectivealtruism.org/funds/animal-welfare\">the Animal Welfare fund&#x2019;s page</a> )&#xA0;you&#x2019;ll see a &#x2018;current balance&#x2019; section outlining the amount currently available to the Fund manager for regranting.</p>\n<p>We hope to expand on this with more detailed reporting functionality in the medium term.&#xA0;Please do note that there will be some variability in the numbers month to month due to foreign exchange fluctuations (balances are held in both USD and GBP) and, at least initially, due to occasional accounting adjustments.</p>\n<p>We note that we&#x2019;ve had the intention to get a system for making Fund/Organization balances visible onto the website since early in the year. However, we faced the challenge of providing a definitive number for the amount of money in a fund. For a number of fairly mundane accounting reasons (e.g. the delay between a donor reporting a donation and us receiving the money via bank transfer or cheque, donors giving outside the EA Funds system, donors changing their donation allocation, complications with accounting for the appreciated value of cryptocurrency post-liquidation and decisions about whether to use numbers derived on a cash or accruals basis), it has been difficult for us to point to a single, canonical number that accurately represents the balance of a given Fund at a given point in time.</p>\n<p>We&#x2019;ve spent the better part of this quarter refining our processes so that we now feel confident that the number that we&#x2019;re pulling from our accounting software is a good representation of the &#x2018;current balance&#x2019; of the fund.</p>\n<h3>A note on differences between March balances and current balances</h3>\n<p>The balances as they appear on each Fund&#x2019;s page are in some cases lower than what the last public update in March (less any grants) would suggest. This is due to the March numbers including accounts payable; money not yet held as cash but expected to come in. The largest difference is in the Animal Welfare Fund&#x2019;s balance, where over $500,000 of such transactions was reported as part of the balance in March.</p>\n<p>It appears that a number of large donations which were reported during the December &#x2018;giving season&#x2019; turned out to be people testing/experimenting with the EA Funds platform; therefore, the March balances included amounts which were never meant as genuine donations. While it&#x2019;s standard accounting practice to report accounts receivable as an asset (and then perform regular write-offs for money that doesn&#x2019;t come in), we recognize this has caused confusion. As such, the account balances displayed on the site now exclude accounts receivable to prevent this confusion going forward.</p>\n<p>We will also continue our work on the accounts in collaboration with our external accounting teams in the UK and US to reduce the need for core CEA staff to spend too much time on this, and we are developing new approaches to our regranting operations, which are currently a highly manual process. This means that we plan to process all regrants at the same time once per quarter.</p>\n<p>We think the EA Funds is uniquely positioned to provide value to the EA community by saving the duplication of similar operations effort at other organisations, and we&#x2019;re excited to keep improving the platform for the benefit of the community.</p>\n<h1>Messaging regarding effectiveness of donations to the managed Funds</h1>\n<p>We initially believed that the four managed Funds would significantly improve the effectiveness of the average EA donation. This was in part based on the assumption that our Fund Managers, drawn from GiveWell and the Open Philanthropy Project, would be able to easily find funding opportunities that they believed to be on par with their &#x2018;institutional&#x2019; grants, but that their respective institutions would be more reticent to fund. We have since updated our thinking on this, because this has turned out not to be the case in all situations and also because we are now more worried about the effect that having Fund Managers exclusively from the Open Philanthropy Project and GiveWell has on the diversity of viewpoints represented in funding decisions within the community.</p>\n<p>We are changing the messaging on the EA Funds site to better reflect this updated thinking. We continue to see the managed Funds as an excellent donation choice for donors who wish to save time and just want to donate whilst knowing their donation effectiveness will meet a very high bar. However, for donors more deeply engaged in the community it is completely plausible they are able to outperform the effectiveness of the managed Funds, especially in situations where they are in a unique position to fund an early stage project they are aware of due to their network, or other similar situations.</p>\n<h1>Further diversification of funding viewpoints: an extra tier of Funds</h1>\n<p>We have also been planning to further increase the diversity of views represented in the managed Funds model by creating a new &#x2018;tier&#x2019; of Funds. Plans for this are still in early stages, and we&#x2019;re not planning to increase the operational complexity of the platform until we have handled our administrative backlog discussed above. However we hope to be able to announce more detailed plans for this in the coming months.</p>\n<p>The basic idea would be to allow less-tested grant makers, with particularly relevant personal networks or potentially less-mainstream views to manage a &#x2018;Junior Fund&#x2019; (working title), where these would not be promoted to the same extent the main four Funds are, but would nevertheless be easily accessible to interested donors. We would then &#x2018;let the market decide&#x2019; to a certain extent on which of these succeed, setting a minimum donation threshold to be reached within the first 12 months for these Funds to continue to be worthwhile to operate. It seems plausible that we could discover highly competent new grant-makers this way.</p>\n<p>We will most likely run a public contest for these positions.</p>\n<h1>Conclusion</h1>\n<p>We would like to seek your feedback on the plans and updates laid out in this post, and I would like to encourage anyone who would like to discuss any of these matters in more detail to reach out to me on funds at effectivealtruism dot org.&#xA0;</p></body></html>", "user": {"username": "MarekDuda"}}, {"_id": "frYYAAa5K4nHqRCPG", "title": "Current Estimates for Likelihood of X-Risk?", "postedAt": "2018-08-06T18:05:54.763Z", "htmlBody": "<p>\n\nIn talking with people about the long-term future, I've found it to be extremely helpful to\u00a0give an estimate for the\u00a0percent chance humanity goes extinct by 2100 (or in 100 years).

Much better is an emphasis on what the best allocation of resources to various cause areas looks like over time and what we need to do to achieve this allocation. In this post I&#x2019;ll lay out one argument for this view.</p>\n<p>When the EA community discusses cause prioritisation, we usually model different causes as additive. However, in the real world, the interactions between many causes aren&#x2019;t additive, but interact in much more complicated ways with each other.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>In this post I&#x2019;ll present how we can model causes whose impact multiplies. If causes simply add together, it makes sense to focus on the cause with the highest impact per dollar. However, if causes multiply, we should locally distribute resources between them according to the ratio of their output elasticities, i.e. how much an increase in investment in one cause affects the outcome as a whole. The output elasticity can be interpreted as a measure of how tractable a cause is. This means that local funding decisions (monetary &#x2018;crowdedness&#x2019;) should be proportional to how tractable the causes are if they&#x2019;re multiplicative.</p>\n<p>Sam Bankman-Fried has <a href=\"http://measuringshadowsblog.blogspot.com/2015/08/multiplicative-factors-in-games-and.html\">written</a> about multiplicative causes with the same output elasticity before, in which case it is optimal to distribute resources between the multiplying causes equally. You might want to read his post before reading this one.</p>\n<p>To illustrate this, think about economic progress vs. cultural progress. If we imagine an economically as well as culturally destitute world, we could pour all our resources into improving our world economically - and could achieve a 1984 or Brave New World dystopia. Or we could pour all our resources into improving it culturally. In that case we might have wonderful relationships with our fellow humans and beautiful art to enjoy, but would still starve and die of illnesses early. Most appealing is the world in which we put an equal amount of resources into economical and cultural progress and much more so than in the alternative worlds. In this world people will live a bit longer and don&#x2019;t starve quite as much while also having acceptable relationships with their peers.</p>\n<p>But this assumes economical vs. cultural progress are similarly tractable. What happens if the amount of resources we put into economical and technological progress multiplies, but putting extra resources in cultural progress doesn&#x2019;t affect cultural progress as much as putting extra resources in economic progress affects economic progress?</p>\n<p>To find an answer to this question, we can look at the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cobb%E2%80%93Douglas_production_function\">Cobb Douglas production function</a> and expand its use. Historically, it describes the inputs of capital and labour and how much output can be produced by those inputs.</p>\n<p>Goods = A * L<sup>alpha</sup> * C<sup>beta</sup>. In this historical version L is the labour input, while alpha is the output elasticity of labour, i.e. how many % more goods will be produced if the amount of labour is increased by 1%. C is the capital input, while beta is the output elasticity of capital. Goods are the output that is being produced. A is the &#x2018;total factor productivity&#x2019; which captures the effects on output that aren&#x2019;t explained by the input variables.</p>\n<p>We can now ask the question how resources between labour and capital should be allocated to maximize the number of goods produced. The mathematically optimal allocation to maximize the output is determined by the ratio between the output elasticities of capital and labour, so alpha:beta. Note that in this case the output elasticities are constants.</p>\n<p>If labour&#x2019;s output elasticity was 1, but capital&#x2019;s output elasticity was 0.1 (though note that those aren&apos;t the true historical ones), then to produce the most goods with a given set of resources it&#x2019;s optimal to put ten times as many resources into labour than into capital.</p>\n<p>If we now adapt the historical Cobb Douglas production function and look at our hypothetical society, we can answer our question:</p>\n<p>Thriving of humanity = A * Resources for economic progress<sup>gamma</sup> * Resources for cultural progress<sup>delta</sup></p>\n<p>A is the factor again that measures everything that results in the thriving of humanity that isn&#x2019;t explained by putting in resources for economic and cultural progress.</p>\n<p>If it is ten times easier to make progress on the thriving of humanity by investing resources in economic progress than by investing resources in cultural progress (i.e. gamma is ten times as big as delta), then as in our previous example the optimal allocation is to spend ten times as many resources on economic progress.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>Thus, the important question to ask for optimal resource allocation in multiplicative scenarios is what the ratio of the output elasticities is. However, output elasticities might change as the inputs change. Most often, the output elasticities won&#x2019;t be constants. This means in many cases the production function will only tell us locally which cause is in most need of more resources to improve the overall outcome.</p>\n<p>To calculate an output elasticity, we need to find out how much increasing the respective input by 1% is affecting the outcome as a percentage. In our example, we look at how many resources are being spent on cultural progress already i.e. how much talent or funding is currently being allocated to it. We then assess how much an increase of 1% is affecting the output. If the thriving of humanity improved by 10% due to the 1% increase of the resources for cultural progress, we have an output elasticity of 10%/1% = 10. If the thriving of humanity improved only by 0.1%, the output elasticity would be 0.1%/1% = 0.1.</p>\n<p>What does all of this mean in practice for cause prioritisation? While many causes aren&#x2019;t actually additive and modelling them as additive might give subpar results, modelling them simply as multiplicative isn&#x2019;t close to perfect either. However, it might still be an improvement.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>Questions for which modelling the problem as multiplicative might be helpful are e.g. whether we should add new talent to the EA community or improve the talent we already have? Should the EA community focus to add its resources on the efforts to reduce GCRs or to add them to efforts to help humanity flourish? We could also think of the technical ideas to improve institutional decision making like improving forecasting abilities as multiplying with those institution&#x2019;s willingness to implement those ideas.</p>\n<p>When we think about global funding in the inputs for our production functions, we fundamentally care about what the EA community can do. So it&#x2019;s important to compare like with like by thinking about the most effective uses of resources that will determine the output elasticities. Note also that while we&#x2019;re looking at such large pools of funding, the EA community will hardly be able to affect the funding ratio substantially. Therefore, this type of exercise will often just show us which single cause should be prioritised by the EA community and thereby act additive after all. This is different if we look at questions with multiplicative factors in which the decisions by the EA community can affect the input ratios like whether we should add more talent to the EA community or focus on improving existing talent.</p>\n<p>Which other cause prioritisation questions can you think of that are better modelled as multiplicative instead of additive?&#xA0;</p>\n<p><strong>TL,DR:</strong> When we try to prioritise between different additive causes, it makes sense to focus on the one with the highest impact per dollar. But if we try to prioritise between different multiplicative causes, we should locally spread our resources between them according to their output elasticity ratios. That means the proportions of funding (&#x2018;crowdedness&#x2019;) should locally be equal to the proportions of the output elasticities (a measure for the &#x2018;tractability&#x2019; of the respective causes).</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p>Thanks to Jacob Hilton who reviewed a draft of this post.</p></body></html>", "user": {"username": "Denise_Melchin"}}, {"_id": "Wab6KrMLaEdqfLatg", "title": "The Ethics of Giving part two: Christine Swanton on the Virtues of Giving", "postedAt": "2018-08-06T11:53:49.744Z", "htmlBody": "<html><body><p>A review and critique of the second section of the volume <em><a href=\"https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-ethics-of-giving-9780190648879?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;\">The Ethics of Giving: Philosophers&apos; Perspectives on Philanthropy</a>,</em> edited by Paul Woodruff, with an emphasis on issues relevant to the decision making of Effective Altruists.</p>\n<p>Christine Swanton is a virtue ethicist who applies a moral theory of &quot;thick concept centralism&quot; (TCC) to beneficence. TCC aims to replace &quot;thin&quot; (i.e. conceptually simple) concepts, like welfare or donations, with &quot;thick&quot; (i.e. conceptually complex) concepts, like kindness and manipulation. This is a radical revision of the way we normally look at the world; for instance, physical facts and moral values are no longer clearly separated under this view. Swanton does not give a full argument for this theory, but attempts to use philanthropy as an issue to illustrate its strength, by showing that it succeeds in solving three ethical problems of giving where thin morality purportedly fails to satisfy competing criteria of normative theory.</p>\n<p>The first problem is supererogation. The issue here is the apparent contradiction between two traditional claims of thin morality: on the one hand, that &quot;we have most reason to produce the most good possible, and we ought to do what we have most reason to do,&quot; and on the other hand, that &#x201C;in certain circumstances agents may choose an action other than the one that would most promote the good,&#x201D; like giving all their spare money away. The first claim is not controversial, especially in consequentialism. But the only reason cited by Swanton to favor the second claim is the issue of demandingness. And it is not widely accepted that this is compelling - not among consequentialists, at least. So Swanton does nothing to illustrate that a problem exists for the consequentialist who is fine with a demanding moral view that contains no room for supererogatory actions. Additionally, Swanton does not address the possibility of scalar consequentialism, where options are merely evaluated as more or less good and none are labeled obligatory. These viewpoints are common in EA, but for someone who can accept neither, Swanton shows that her theory can avoid the conceptual problem of supererogation.</p>\n<p>The second bug in the traditional thin picture of philanthropy is underdetermination. Swanton states that &quot;A classic problem in the ethics of beneficence and philanthropy is that of underdetermination by reason; for example, reason does not determine to whom one should give, how much, and to how many.&quot; This contradicts the idea that it is rational to do that which we have the most reason to do. There are two ways that reason can underdetermine, <a href=\"https://philarchive.org/archive/CHAVRA-2\">according to the philosopher Ruth Chang.</a> First, we may end up with multiple incommensurable alternatives. And second, we may end up without any justified choice.</p>\n<p>It&apos;s worth noting that Chang&apos;s idea of incommensurability is not the same as the philosophically strong idea of incomparability; it is a matter of practical reasoning where we have no overall reason to regard one option as better than another. But then it seems clear to me that the phrase &quot;that which we have the most reason to do&quot; can refer to anything that is tied for being the most reasonable option. I think readers will generally agree that this banal observation solves the first manifestation of the purported contradiction.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the idea of there being no justified choice is often considered an informal analogue of incomparability: the idea is that sometimes one does not have enough reason to sufficiently support any one action. In her words, reason can &quot;break down&quot;. That there are any cases like this is controversial, but in theoretical reason it&apos;s clearer still when nothing like this can occur: we must rank all options on a single ordered list, which means that there will always be either one best option or a tie, with no incomparabilities. One reason to suppose that this is always possible is that generally we think that options are to be evaluated by their expected value. No matter how great our uncertainty, subjective probability theory still gives us quantitative expectations, which means that the expected values of all options will always have one neat ordering. And even if we are morally uncertain about how to measure value in the first place, <a href=\"http://commonsenseatheism.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/MacAskill-Normative-Uncertainty.pdf\">William MacAskill has demonstrated</a> that a framework of maximizing expected choiceworthiness is appropriate and similarly yields a cardinal list of options. But even if we reject this substantive picture of value maximization, we can defer to a much more basic picture: all options are equally reasonable by default, and as we introduce reasons we merely see them change our ranking of some charities relative to others. This logic is easy to see in EA charity evaluation, as cause neutrality has us assume that all charities are of equal value before letting various considerations lead us to elevate our effectiveness estimates of some over others.</p>\n<p>The above picture still requires us to choose arbitrarily in cases of ties. Swanton&apos;s central argument is that it is better to let one&apos;s choice be guided by &quot;narrative virtue&quot; - to go with the flow of what seems to be the path that life has laid out for you. When practical reason leaves multiple options on the table, it feels right that we should make our choices fitting in the moment and inspired, rather than vacillating and picking arbitrarily. But the text doesn&apos;t discuss a much simpler alternative takeaway from this intuition: we have practical reasons not to vacillate, and we have practical reasons to allow oneself to feel inspired.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>The third problem is one of collective action. This is the question of why one should do something that makes no apparent impact upon a large problem. Why eat vegan, if the supermarket buys a thousand pounds of meat at a time? Why vote, if it won&apos;t make the difference in the election? There is a tension between the apparent moral reason to take part in such efforts and the lack of a causal connection behind personal action and group impact. Swanton argues that her theory accounts for this issue well compared to other attempts to give an ethical account of free-riding, parasitism, and collective action, but doesn&apos;t address the standard EA view, that one&apos;s actions do have an *expected* impact in such cases: they might be the one action that makes the difference between a collective action occurring or not, as well as having other benefits. Swanton would presumably appeal to rigid thought experiments where this expected impact does not exist, in which case we might simply deny that we ought to act at all, given the absence of a causal connection between our actions and the outcomes. Swanton&apos;s response to this kind of denial, which is also present in <a href=\"https://philpapers.org/archive/NEFFPA.pdf\">Julia Nefsky&apos;s framework</a>, is just to boldly assert that causal logic is the inappropriate framework for looking at moral actions.</p>\n<p>Overall, I have to say that I was disappointed by Swanton&apos;s chapter because it ignored common EA solutions to all three of the problems that it evaluated, when EA is perhaps the textbook example of a thin-concepts approach to philanthropy. We already solve the problem of supererogation by either accepting demandingness or adopting scalar consequentialism. We already solve the problem of undetermination by having a formal approach to decision theory and cost-effectiveness estimation rather than relying on vague notions of practical reason. And we already solve the collective action problem by following expected value theory.</p>\n<p>It&apos;s worth noting, though, that this chapter is just one piece of the puzzle regarding a comprehensive question of moral theory. It may be the case that Swanton&apos;s argument provides reasons in favor of TCC, but that other moral problems in other contexts count in the opposite direction, in which case you still should not abide by TCC&apos;s recommendations on the subject of charity. Conversely, just because our standard philosophical views succeed in handling all these cases does not mean that they are the right ones to use, because TCC might be true for other reasons. But my impression from the text is that the philosophy required to understand it and support it is abstruse - it stems from Heideggerian ontology and metaphysics. And for those of us who see concepts like desire and suffering as clear and meaningful phenomena in their own right, the idea that we should disparage them in favor of vague social constructs which only crudely and unreliably conform to our own moral intuitions is a tall order.</p></body></html>", "user": {"username": "kbog"}}, {"_id": "5uWX6iNhaMp6Gnz7q", "title": "Bangladesh is in Desperate Need For Effective Altruists", "postedAt": "2018-08-05T04:29:27.261Z", "htmlBody": "<html><body><p>Hello all,</p>\n<p>I&apos;ve only recently come across the effective altruism community, and I have to say that I&apos;m thrilled to see so many people actively seeking the best ways to make positive impact. It&apos;s absolutely refreshing and pushes one to do the same, reminding one that our time here on Earth should be devoted to understanding the best ways we can do good.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>I&apos;m grateful to now be a part of this community. I write this post however, in distressing circumstances. I am in no doubt that the members in this group are of the highest calibre and have empathy. I write here to be heard and in search for advice. I apologize if this post seems a bit long.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>In Bangladesh, my home nation, among many things that are wrong with this country, the transport system is poorly managed by the government. Most bus services are privately owned and therefore many bus companies compete with each other over which bus gets to pick up the most passengers. These give rise to fierce battles on the road where multiple buses race each other to get to a bus stand first to claim a larger share of the waiting passengers. On 29th July 2018, at around 12:30 PM, two such buses of different companies competed against each other on a prominent street in Dhaka, the Bangladeshi capital. The buses tried to overtake one another in an attempt to reach the bus stand first. As one stopped, the other bus sped past the side and ploughed into the crowd. Two were killed on the spot. At least nine others were severely injured. The deceased were 18 and 17 years old, studying in the 12th and 11th grade. One dreamt of becoming an army officer. The other told her parents she wanted to raise her family from poverty by becoming a banker.</p>\n<p>Immediately after the incident, students of the same school the deceased studied in went on a rampage, vandalising over a hundred vehicles on the busy streets in the capital. The vehicles vandalised were only the ones used for public transport. Passengers of these vehicles were asked to get down so that the protestors could torch the vehicles without hurting anybody. The numbers of the protestors rose, reaching several hundred. The actions and gathering of the protesting students led to blocks in key city junctions, causing traffic and congestion. The protests were a retaliation to years of unsafety in the roads of Dhaka due to reckless driving, and reluctance to follow traffic rules by vehicle drivers all over the city, finally reaching the tipping point after the tragic incident.</p>\n<p>In protest, the students had made a nine-point charter of demands, which required the government to take measures to ensure safety for the citizens, such as construction of more foot overbridges for safe movement over busy roads, setting up speed breakers in every accident prone road, and strict regulation preventing drivers to drive without proper training or licences and updated paperwork. Other demands included capital punishment for the drivers leading to the death of the two students, and for the government to accept responsibility for the accidents that have been taking place for so long in the city. Failure to meet these demands would result in further vandalisation of vehicles and massive rallies throughout the capital. The shipping minister and transport leader of the nation responded to the incident saying &quot;A road crash has claimed thirty-three lives in India&apos;s Maharashtra; but do they talk about it like the way we do?&quot; Clearly with the leaders refusing to be accountable for the terrible mismanagement of the country&apos;s systems, even more fuel was added to the protestors&apos; fire.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>As the protests went on, the movement evolved in a telling way. The movement prioritized peacefulness. Thousands of students strategically taking to the busiest roads began assuming the role of the traffic enforcers. They checked every car that passed, ensuring the driver had a legitimate license. Those without a license were not allowed to pass. They navigated complex junctions to increase fluidity and reduce congestion. They even made sure that every car maintained proper lanes, carving out an emergency lane for ambulances and fire-trucks which the city was crying out for but the government never provided out of sheer laziness. These were all fifteen to nineteen year olds. They were doing the jobs of the traffic officers, the law enforcers. They were doing their jobs better. They, the youth of the nation, were leading by example. Grabbing the city by the hand and showing it the society they dreamt of living in. A peaceful society. A lawful society. The youth did not accept bribes. The youth did not condone unlawful behavior. The youth did not tolerate ignorance. The youth did not want to go the direction of apathy the so called leaders of the nation were allowing the country to slip into.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>The government finally accepted the demands on the 1st of August, and said they would comply with the measures the students put forward. The protests&apos; intensity had mitigated slightly since the objective had seemed to be achieved. However, the protestors were wary of the government stating their cooperation purely to bring an end to the movement. It had happened before earlier in the year during the citizens&apos; protest against an unfair quota system on government job recruitment, where the government stated their compliance, but did not yet fully install the improved system the citizens rallied for. With this in mind, the movement maintained its structure and still decided to rally on until tangible results were seen.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>But on Saturday, 4th of August, the unthinkable happened. An unidentifiable group of people attacked the peaceful protestants while they were at their rallies, in various sections across the city. These people were sided by the police, who were taking orders from their corrupt leaders, to disrupt the movement. The unidentified groups came at the protestants with batons, large sticks, and guns. Horrific rumours circled around the capital, that four students were seen dead from the attacks. That two underage girls were raped. The facts however, were that the students were attacked, and they were injured. Photos spread all over social media in wake of the attacks, of students in critical conditions being taken to nearby hospitals. The unidentified groups were rumoured to be paid mercenaries, unleashed by the student wing (called Bangladesh Chatra League) of the political party now in power (called Awami League). No one can say for sure why these attacks were made, but there is absolutely no doubt that they took place, and in order to disrupt the movement. Deluges of videos surfaced on social media of protestants screaming in horror claiming that they had seen their friends being taken away for rape. That female protestants were kidnapped and held captive and that their friends went missing from the protest. The local news failed to keep up with the constant updates that appeared on social media, insinuating that these news outlets may have been instructed by the government to show limited footage to prevent the true picture of the events to be known. All the updates on social media had apparently been coming from the protestants themselves. I myself have seen many such videos, and I have seen how these mercenaries have brutally attacked peaceful protestants, violating every fabric of human rights we as a global society have come to accept.</p>\n<p>My own friends were almost embroiled in such encounters, and had to run to safety for their mortality was at stake. We know that Bangladesh no longer sees fair elections. We know that we are not truly a democracy. We fear that the government is using brute force to quell the disarray, because they know they will stay in power. It may be too early to tell but we fear the start of a dictatorship. We know the Prime Minister is aware of everything that is going on. We know she is responsible for the injuries of these protesting students. We are yet to find out if she is responsible for any more deaths or cases of rape. I myself being a local cannot yet see the logic in these attacks. It all just seems completely senseless, and it is soul crushing to live in this day and age and have to witness such oppression right outside our doorsteps. Nothing the protestors are raising their voices for is unconstitutional. They&apos;re simply asking people to follow the law. Driving on a valid license is the law. Getting one&apos;s vehicle road fitness tested is the law. Driving on one&apos;s own side of the road is the law. Children are protesting against breaking the law in their school uniform, hence they are not partisan. Asking for accountability from your &apos;elected&apos; officials is the most constitutional right in a democracy, which we call ourselves to the outside world. The students are exercising that right. WHY is there violence? WHY must there be bloodshed? WHY are they being deprived freedom of speech?&#xA0;</p>\n<p>The youth do not want to sit still and helpless. We do not want the efforts of our youth to go in vain. Many of us who maintained distance from the protest and attacks tried to do our part by reaching out to international news outlets. We have been recognized by BBC, Yahoo, and Fox News. We managed to become 7th trending in Reddit. We have been making efforts to trend worldwide in Twitter using the hashtags #WeWantJustice, #Bangladesh, #WeWantJusticeForBangladesh and the hashtags of several news agencies.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>This post is just as much a plea for advice as it is to raise awareness. Bangladesh needs effective altruists now more than ever. Bangladesh is neglected, and has massive potential for the most impact. Please advise me on what I can do. Will contacting the United Nations Human Rights Council help? Is there a way to contact them with fewer barriers? Is there a network here that can give this crisis more recognition? Is there a way to involve more institutions to help tackle this? At this point it just seems like external international pressure may cause the violence to stop at least. Just my hunch, please correct me if there is a better way to go about this. Even if I&apos;m speaking on the wrong platform, maybe you can suggest where I should be raising my voice to induce proactive solutions. I&apos;m 21 years old and I don&apos;t want anymore people to get hurt. I don&apos;t want my country to be taken over by corruption. There&apos;s so much potential here. So many good people. Why should all that be spoilt because of incompetent greedy monsters who do not understand what life is?&#xA0;</p>\n<p>If you wish to contact me, please email me at farhannayeem.8@gmail.com</p>\n<p>I can show you videos and images of what&apos;s happening in Bangladesh, the suffering, the senselessness. This movement is also not free from exaggerations as with many social incidents, but there cannot be any smoke without fire. The fact that the attacks happened, regardless if there were actually as many deaths as claimed, or as many rape cases as claimed, are proof enough that something in Dhaka is fundamentally wrong.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>Please let&apos;s put the Effective Altruism community to good use in these dire circumstances.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>Thank you so so much for reading this entire post.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>Love,</p>\n<p>Farhan Nayeem</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p></body></html>", "user": {"username": "Farhan"}}, {"_id": "knMYeBDJqC5d9vonH", "title": "Harvard EA's 2018\u201319 Vision", "postedAt": "2018-08-04T22:47:29.289Z", "htmlBody": "<html><body><h1><strong>A Vision for Harvard EA, 2018&#x2013;19</strong></h1>\n<p>Cullen O&#x2019;Keefe, President</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1i1-57jRg7vrcTBXAcqIFAYzGoC-bftIMnElqPKFGMVk/edit?usp=sharing\">Google Doc Version</a>&#xA0;(easier-to-read with footnotes)</p>\n<h2><strong>Preface</strong></h2>\n<p>This document will hopefully provide a short, comprehensible, and concrete model for how I would like to run the Harvard University Effective Altruism Student Group (&#x201C;HUEASG&#x201D;)&#xA0; this year.[1] I&#x2019;m sharing it here so that other EA leaders to use it to the extent they find useful.[2]</p>\n<p>This third draft is a result of synthesizing ideas from the below documents, receiving feedback from readers of earlier drafts as well as from conversations with other EA leaders (to whom I am immensely grateful).&#xA0;</p>\n<h2><strong>Foundational Texts</strong></h2>\n<p>(Read these first if you haven&#x2019;t)</p>\n<p>&#x25CF; Ales Flidr &amp; James Aung, <a href=\"/ea/1nh/heuristics_from_running_harvard_and_oxford_ea/\">Heuristics from Running Harvard and Oxford EA Groups</a></p>\n<p>&#x25CF; CEA, <a href=\"https://www.centreforeffectivealtruism.org/a-three-factor-model-of-community-building/\">A Three-Factor Model of Community Building</a> [hereinafter, Three-Factor Model]</p>\n<p>&#x25CF; CEA, <a href=\"https://www.centreforeffectivealtruism.org/the-funnel-model/\">The Funnel Model</a> [hereinafter, Funnel Model]</p>\n<p>&#x25CF; CEA, <a href=\"https://app.effectivealtruism.org/groups/resources/a-model-of-an-ea-group\">A Model of an EA Group</a> [hereinafter, Model of a Group]</p>\n<p>&#x25CF; CEA, <a href=\"https://www.centreforeffectivealtruism.org/ceas-current-thinking/\">CEA&#x2019;s Current Thinking</a> [hereinafter, Current Thinking]</p>\n<p>&#x25CF; CEA, <a href=\"https://app.effectivealtruism.org/groups/resources/effective-altruism-community-building\">Effective Altruism Community Building</a> [hereinafter, Community Building]</p>\n<p><strong>Guiding Principles</strong></p>\n<p>It would be needlessly redundant to try to formulate, from scratch, a set of values for HUEASG. Instead, I will stress the importance of remaining aligned with the most recent principles and best practices published by EA leaders (e.g., CEA).[3]&#xA0; CEA&#x2019;s current definition of EA is: &#x201C;using evidence and reason to figure out how to benefit others as much as possible, and taking action on that basis.&#x201D;[4]&#xA0; CEA lists the following as EA guiding principles:[5]&#xA0;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Commitment to others</li>\n<li>Scientific Mindset</li>\n<li>Openness</li>\n<li>Integrity</li>\n<li>Collaborative Spirit[6]&#xA0;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p>Current thinking within CEA endorses a <strong>long-termist</strong> approach to EA: &#x201C;We believe that the most effective opportunities to do good are aimed at helping the long-term future.&#x201D;[7]&#xA0; HUEASG should mirror this,[8] without marginalizing or eschewing short-term causes.&#xA0; Note that this encompasses both prevention of existential risk and &#x201C;trajectory shifting.&#x201D;[9]&#xA0;</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p>Some might think that this framing conflicts with our fundamental commitment to cause neutrality.[10]&#xA0; However, as we use it here, &#x201C;cause-neutral&#x201D; means roughly &#x201C;cause-impartial&#x201D;: &#x201C;select[ing] causes based on impartial estimates of impact.&#x201D;[11]&#xA0; Thus, it is perfectly compatible with impartially-reached cause <em>decidedness</em>.[12]&#xA0; Furthermore, long-termism is an epistemic framing rather than a cause:[13]&#xA0; it encourages us to pay substantial consideration to interventions&#x2019; long-term effects. &#x201C;However, we recognize that this argument rests on some significant moral and empirical assumptions, and so we remain uncertain about how valuable the long-term future is relative to other problems. We think that there are other important cause areas, particularly animal welfare and effective global health interventions [even when considering only the short-term effects of these].&#x201D;[14]&#xA0; Thus, the long-termist framing effects a quantitative change of focus, not a wholesale rejection of any particular cause.[15]&#xA0;</p>\n<h2><strong>Role of HUEASG Within EA</strong></h2>\n<p>Generalizing a bit, mainstream EA organizations are not primarily funding-constrained.[16]&#xA0; Meanwhile, important talent gaps persist within major organizations.[17]&#xA0; A related observation is that &#x201C;some people have the potential to be disproportionately impactful. It appears as though some people may be many orders of magnitude more impactful than average just by virtue of the resources (money, skills, network) they have available.&#x201D;[18]&#xA0;</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p>Because of these and other factors, most value from our group will likely come from <span><strong>Core EAs</strong></span>&#x2014;<em>roughly, people who give &#x2265;80% weighting to EA considerations when deciding on a</em> career[19]<em> path.</em>[20]<em>&#xA0; Key routes to value are, therefore:</em> catalyzing,[21]<em>&#xA0;</em> cultivating,[22]<em>&#xA0; and retaining</em>[23]<em> potential Core EAs.</em></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p>Relatedly, Harvard EA likely creates the most value for the EA community by playing to our <a href=\"https://conceptually.org/concepts/comparative-advantage/\">comparative advantages</a>. Our main comparative advantage is access to young, promising,[24] and well-connected students.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p>Since students broadly lack the resources, skills, and knowledge to be immediately useful to the EA community,[25] this all implies that our priorities should be:[26]&#xA0;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Catalyzing, cultivating, and retaining Core EAs, with a special emphasis on educating Core EAs on the intellectual/academic foundations of effective altruism[27]&#xA0;</li>\n<li>Helping Core EAs devise career plans[28]&#xA0;</li>\n<li>Directing Core EAs to useful resources and upskilling opportunities</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><strong>Relation to the Funnel Model</strong></h2>\n<p>Given the above, a major heuristic for HUEASG activities should be how they fit in with the Funnel Model. That is, we should ask ourselves, &#x201C;How will this activity move people further down the funnel?&#x201D;[29]&#xA0; &#x201C;Trying to get a few people all the way through the funnel is more important than getting every person to the next stage.&#x201D;[30]&#xA0; I explore the implications of this below.</p>\n<h3><strong>The Top of the Funnel: &#x201C;Taste of EA&#x201D;</strong></h3>\n<p>This idea draws heavily from Flidr &amp; Aung.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Introduction to EA&#x201D;-type events have been the default beginning-of-the-year activity for a while. I think we should move away from this model for a number of reasons. First, I worry that &#x201C;Intro to EA&#x201D; events are potentially <em>low fidelity</em>, which can have bad effects on our group reputation and EA generally.[31]&#xA0; Relatedly, since EA comprises a number of nuanced ideas across several different academic disciplines, Intro to EA events that are expansive enough to cover all important points are not very deep, and are likely overwhelming to newcomers.[32]&#xA0;</p>\n<p>Flidr &amp; Aung therefore offer the following advice:</p>\n<p>[T]hink about outreach efforts as an &#x2018;offer&#x2019; of EA where people can get a taste of what it&#x2019;s about and take it or leave it. It&#x2019;s OK if someone&#x2019;s not interested. A useful heuristic James used for testing whether to run an outreach event is to ask &#x201C;to what extent would the audience member now know whether effective altruism is an idea they would be interested in?&#x201D; It turned out that many speaker events that Oxford were running didn&#x2019;t fit this test, and neither did the fundraising campaign.</p>\n<p>Don&apos;t &quot;introduce EA&quot;. It&apos;s fine if people don&apos;t come across EA ideas in a particular sequence. First, find entry points that capture a person&apos;s interest. If someone finds EA interesting and likes the community, they will absorb the basics pretty soon.</p>\n<p>My own model is that Core EAs usually need a few very important traits:</p>\n<p>(1) Dedication to doing good[33]&#xA0;</p>\n<p>(2) Human capital (i.e., skills and resources)[34]&#xA0;</p>\n<p>(3) Reliability/dependability</p>\n<p>(4) Knowledge of topics related to effective altruism[35]</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p>Early outreach efforts should optimize for some combination of (1) and (4).[36]&#xA0; That is, we should should aim at enticing people predisposed to doing good and people from fields with a strong track record of producing Core EAs (e.g., philosophy, computer science, economics, biology).[37]&#xA0; Optimization for the remaining traits comes at later stages of the funnel.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p>Admittedly, I still don&#x2019;t have a great idea of what this will look like. Combined with insights from Oxford EAs, my experience at HLS suggests that introductory talks and student org fairs are still lucrative mass outreach tools. However, going forward I expect to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>put more emphasis on introducing the main motivations for EA (e.g., differential cost-effectiveness, lack of quantification and evidence)</li>\n<li>put more emphasis on introducing specific, representative projects that EAs do, the value of which is comprehensible to non-EAs</li>\n<li>put less emphasis on more specific concepts in EA (e.g., scope insensitivity, long-termism)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p>Huw Thomas suggests that focused outreach to students in historically EA-productive disciplines (e.g., computer science) might also be worthwhile. However, to promote group diversity, broad outreach is still highly desirable.</p>\n<h3><strong>Next Steps: 1-on-1s</strong></h3>\n<p>1-on-1s (1:1s) are a good next step for several reasons.[38]&#xA0; First, they begin to screen (albeit very lightly) for the third trait-cluster Core EAs need: reliability/dependability.[39]&#xA0; Second, 1:1s offer a good way to build friendship with potential Core EAs (more later). Third, they offer a good way to communicate EA ideas in a more high-fidelity manner.[40]&#xA0; Finally, they offer a good opportunity to &#x201C;signpost&#x201D;: point newcomers to existing EA literature[41] and organizations that suit their interests,[42] thus increasing their knowledge of EA.</p>\n<h3><strong>The Expanding Core</strong></h3>\n<p>The final step, of course, is to continue the Funnel process by moving committed individuals towards Core involvement. I admit that I don&#x2019;t have a solid model for what this should look like. If my hypothesis about what traits a Core EA needs is correct, then the person should be largely self-motivated to continue to learn EA content on their own. If this too is right, then perhaps most of the value from org leadership can do is from:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Preventing or slowing down attrition</li>\n<li>Continuing to signpost to and networking on behalf[43] of the newcomer</li>\n<li>Aiding in career planning[44]</li>\n<li>Activities aimed at increasing follow-through with EA-informed career plans[45]&#xA0;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I imagine that formal events will be less important to this process than developing a sense of community with newer Core members.[46]&#xA0; Getting new and prospective Core EAs to feel at home in and strongly identify with EA is likely one of the best ways to get them to remain in the Core. Social events seem like a good way to achieve this. We should also ask current org members about what programming they would find valuable.[47]</p>\n<h2><strong>Implications for Group Structure and Function</strong></h2>\n<h3><strong>Specialize Events and Roles</strong></h3>\n<p>School groups should map their planning to the Funnel Model.[48]&#xA0; For groups with sufficient personnel, it might make sense to begin to specialize for each stage, too (i.e., have dedicated outreach, 1:1, and Core leads).&#xA0;</p>\n<p>Note that, although these are ordinal steps, there is no reason why a group cannot make parallel efforts at each level (including regular 1:1s).[49] That is, the Funnel does not have to map cleanly onto the entire school year, with outreach happening only at the beginning.</p>\n<h2><strong>Focus on Skill-Building</strong></h2>\n<p>While we should encourage EAs to embrace other means of upskilling,[50] we should also grow Core EAs&#x2019; human capital when it plays to our comparative advantages.[51]&#xA0; Along this line, Ales Flidr suggests &#x201C;[f]ocusing on the memes of rationality, prioritization and exploring unconventional options [for doing good].&#x201D;</p>\n<h3>Strong Focus on Structured EA Social Events</h3>\n<p>This model puts a strong emphasis on community social events, since I think those are quite likely to effectively move people down the Funnel and retain Core EAs. Such social events, however, should be somewhat structured while still allowing ample time for casual socializing.&#xA0;</p>\n<h3><strong>Implications for Pledge Work</strong></h3>\n<p>This implies that we should put less emphasis on pledge work. I think there&#x2019;s still a place for such work now,[53] but such work should not be the main activity of our groups except insofar as it is a good mechanism for driving group organizers to stay committed.[54]&#xA0;&#xA0;</p>\n<p>Ideally, an EA organization would have programming cleanly differentiated to engage people in all stages of the Funnel (including those unlikely to move further down). In such a world, pledge work would remain valuable as a way to get non-Core EAs (and others) to enact EA principles. Indeed, I think it&#x2019;s plausible that a lot of EA&#x2019;s future value will come from changing norms about philanthropy, if not career choice. But right now, we probably lack the personnel to enact such a tiered approach. In the long run, it might be worthwhile to consider creating two subsidiary EA groups: one focused on traditional pledge-type work and one focused on career choice.[55]&#xA0;</p>\n<h3>Other Avenues for Value</h3>\n<p>Ales Flidr suggests the following as possible means of creating value with HUEASG:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Targeted relationship building with key professors and their grad students, particularly those who have a good chance</li>\n<li>Related, studying people who went through the law school (professors, students) who had the greatest impact on the world. What they did, how they interacted with groups, etc. Similarly research current faculty and students.</li>\n<li>Study what concretely most successful groups (by our metrics, i.e., thinking and behavior change) do.</li>\n<li>Trying to create better working connections with [academic EA institutions like the Research Scholars Programme] and GPI</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Endnotes</h2>\n<p>[1] This encompasses all Harvard schools except for Harvard College.</p>\n<p>[2] The following people have been especially influential to my thinking: Frankie Andersen-Wood, James Aung, Chris Bakerlee, Harri Besceli, Ryan Carey, Holly Elmore, Ales Flidr, Eric Gastfriend, Kit Harris, Jacob Lagerros, Ed Lawrence, Darius Meissner, Linh Chi Nguyen, Alex Norman, Huw Thomas, and Hayden Wilkinson.

H/T Darius Meissner.</p>\n<p>[25]&#xA0; See Flidr &amp; Aung.</p>\n<p>[26]&#xA0; A comment from Holly Elmore: &#x201C;I&apos;m torn between this path and a path of spreading the word through Harvard. My guess is that the latter raises the prestige of EA among influential people, re-anchors people on doing more charity than they previously considered, and increases the chance of finding potential core EAs. The former (the one you have here) seems to make EA into a secret society. There&apos;s something uncomfortable about that to me, but I&apos;m open to it. I think HUEA/HCEA were strongest when we had a lot of public-facing things and a big behind-the-scenes focus on core organizers. The organizers had something to that was more immediately altruistic than planning their careers and it kept them in touch with the basics of EA.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p>I&#x2019;m largely in agreement with this. I also agree that long-run changes in cultural attitudes towards philanthropy are potentially an important part of EA&#x2019;s expected value. However, while I think there continues to be value in those activities&#x2014;and so we should therefore not eschew them&#x2014;the foregoing consideration make this seem less valuable as compared to developing Core EAs, though still absolutely valuable. We are agreed that direct work is good for boosting morale and keeping people engaged.</p>\n<p>[27]&#xA0; See CEA, Community Building. H/T Darius Meissner.</p>\n<p>[28]&#xA0; Holly Elmore raised the following questions in a previous draft: &#x201C;Are we just a feeder for EA orgs or should we consider part of our role to cultivate creative thinking about how to accomplish a lot of good? Or are you just saying we shouldn&apos;t encourage earning to give and instead focus on developing people who are well-versed in and dedicated to EA?&#x201D;</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p>Regarding the first question, I see &#x201C;creative thinking about how to accomplish a lot of good&#x201D; as perfectly compatible with my definition of Core EA. More specifically, being a &#x201C;Core EA&#x201D; need not and should not be limited to pursuing curren 80K priority career paths. Indeed, more individualized&#x2014;and by extension less orthodox&#x2014;guidance might play to our comparative advantage since we have the opportunity to develop closer relationships to Core EAs than organizations like 80K. Also, &#x201C;career&#x201D; might be defined more loosely than &#x201C;what one does to pay the bills.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p>On the second question, current CEA thinking is that &#x201C;[w]e think that the community continues to benefit from some people focused on earning-to-give . . . .&#x201D; CEA, Current Thinking; see also 80K, <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/career-reviews/\">Career Reviews</a> (recommending or sometimes recommending several careers at least partially for ETG reasons). &#x201C;Roughly, we think that if an individual is a good fit to work on the most important problems, this should probably be their focus, even if they have a high earning potential. If direct work is not a good fit, individuals can continue to have a significant impact through donations.&#x201D; CEA, Current Thinking.</p>\n<p>[29]&#xA0; Cf.

Flidr &amp; Aung (&#x201C;Default to 1:1&apos;s. In hindsight, it is somewhat surprising that 1:1 conversations are not the default student group activity. They have a number of benefits: you get to know people on a personal level, you can present information in a nuanced way, you can tailor recommended resources to individual interests etc. Proactively reach out to members in your community and offer to grab a coffee with them or go for a walk. 1:1&apos;s also give you a good yardstick to evaluate how valuable longer projects have to be to be worth executing: e.g. a 7-hour project would have to be at least as valuable as 7 1:1&apos;s, other things equal. Caveat: we definitely don&#x2019;t mean to imply that you should cut all group or larger-scale activities. We will share some ideas for such activities in a follow-up post.&#x201D;).</p>\n<p>[39]&#xA0; The idea being that willingness to sign up for a 1:1 is somewhat indicative of one&#x2019;s openness to EA and to putting serious thought into doing good generally. This is distinct from screening for moral dedication: Frankie Andersen-Wood and Darius Meissner usefully point out that for many people, moral dedication/conviction develops over time with exposure to, e.g., moral philosophy.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p>Linh Chi Nguyen and Chris Bakerlee rightly suggest that, while 1:1s are valuable, other modes of outreach and onboarding retain value. One example is allowing people to &#x201C;nonbindingly sit in a discussion round where they can check out if they like the (people in the) community.&#x201D; H/T Linh Chi Nguyen.</p>\n<p>[40]&#xA0; See Vaughan, supra note 31 (&#x201C;An example of a high fidelity method of communicating EA would be a lengthy personal conversation.

Flidr &amp; Aung (&#x201C;Don&apos;t teach, signpost. Avoid the temptation to teach EA to people. There&#x2019;s a lot of great online content, and you won&#x2019;t be able to explain the same ideas as well or in as much nuance as longform written content, well-prepared talks or podcast episodes.&#x201D;).</p>\n<p>[41]&#xA0; Darius Meissner suggests that lending out EA books might be a good way to do this.</p>\n<p>[42]&#xA0; Cf.

I agree with Chris Bakerlee that &#x201C;events I&apos;ve been to at Eric [Gastfriend]&#x2019;s are a pretty good model: nominally focused on a specific topic (e.g., the state of EA animal advocacy; end-of-year donation discussion) but allowing plenty of time and opportunity for people to mill about, munch on things, and talk about whatever. Something that would be advertised via facebook event rather than postering the Science Center.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>[53]&#xA0; Mainly because this new model is novel. Although we should feel free to change trajectories and priorities if we think it&#x2019;s more effective, I think a complete break from pledge organizations right now would damage our relationships with historically supportive organizations. This is probably a bad dynamic to undertake without very good reason to think that we have a better plan. Cf. Schubert &amp; Cotton-Barratt, supra note 6. Such work is also valuable because, anecdotally, a number of Core EAs (e.g., me) have become Core EAs by first being interested in global poverty pledge work. So supporting this on-ramp is an important part of the Funnel too.</p>\n<p>[54]&#xA0; H/T Holly Elmore.</p>\n<p>[55]&#xA0; I understand Oxford EA is considering this.</p></body></html>", "user": {"username": "Cullen_OKeefe"}}, {"_id": "FA794RppcqrNcEgTC", "title": "Why are you here?

Here&apos;s mine.</em></p>\n<p><em>&#xA0;</em></p>\n<h1>Introduction</h1>\n<p>I generally find &quot;origin stories&quot; - personal accounts of how people first become involved with EA - to be quite illuminating, and I think that the bulk of their value comes from their aggregation. We have <a href=\"https://rtcharity.org/tag/ea-survey-2017/\">a lot of data on this at a high level</a>, but I would expect a much smaller number of stories at a much finer level of granularity to be about as useful. You might notice particular communities that many EA folk were involved in before EA. You might see particular articles, individuals, ideas or events that were common formative moments for people. Or you might spot common features of paths of people from underrepresented groups in EA[1]. All of these things can help inform more effective strategies for community-building.</p>\n<p>I often ask about origin stories in person. (Pro tip: &quot;Why are you here?&quot; is great for clickbait, bit confrontational for a first meeting; try &quot;How did you get involved in EA?&quot;, &quot;What was it about EA that first appealed to you?&quot;, &quot;What brings you here today?&quot; or even simply &quot;What&apos;s your story? Tell me more about you.&quot;) But it&apos;s very difficult for me or others to spot trends in a collection of anecdotes stored in my brain, so I invite you all to share your story here. If you&apos;d like me to share it anonymously on your behalf, you can share it <a href=\"http://www.admonymous.com/holly_morgan\">here</a>. Readers, don&apos;t forget the sampling bias we have, e.g. if &quot;I used to be part of this other online forum&quot; comes up a lot in these stories, no that does not mean that EA folk basically all love online forums.</p>\n<p>Share as much as you wish to. One line is fine. If longer, don&apos;t feel that you need to explain any gaps or vagueness (but of course, please don&apos;t be deliberately misleading). Don&apos;t censor yourself too much with the thought that &quot;Oh that&apos;s probably just me - that bit won&apos;t be useful for spotting trends&quot;. And consider including any &quot;sub&quot; origin stories that are applicable e.g. How did you first join an offline or online community? What&apos;s the story behind your first significant donation or altruistically-motivated career change? When have you made a significant shift in cause prioritisation and why?</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p>I&apos;ll go first.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<h1>Why I&apos;m here</h1>\n<h2>Childhood</h2>\n<p>Thanks to an obsession with record-keeping and a good memory, I can see some very early roots. As a child I had a standard magic wish: &quot;Happiness for everyone forever.&quot; I (told myself I) killed spiders because that&apos;s one quick death for a spider against many flies being slowly eaten alive. My favourite games were &quot;schools&quot; i.e. &quot;teach my sister to read despite her protests&quot; and &quot;boat crash&quot;/&quot;plane crash&quot; i.e. &quot;all of my toys are on the verge of death and we manage to save them all&quot;. A consequentialist hero syndrome if ever there was one.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<h2>Early teens</h2>\n<p>In my early teens, teachers and friends prompted me to think more about ethics and rationality within the context of religion. I ended a school essay on abortion with &quot;if there&apos;s no pain, there&apos;s no problem&quot; (referring to the foetus). I went to church for two years for reasoning similar to Pascal&apos;s Wager, despite this choice generally leading to a lot of misery for me and everyone around me. At this particular church, I was made fun of for considering Islam and for Googling for more questions about Christianity rather than for answers, and the judgements of my romantic life really stung, but my poor fellow churchgoers did try so hard with me and must have thought me mad for attending for so long as a very anguished agnostic.</p>\n<p>At some point in this period I also became a moral non-cognitivist (thought that &quot;right&quot;, &quot;wrong&quot;, &quot;good&quot;, &quot;bad&quot; etc. didn&apos;t refer to anything fundamental in the universe) - I&apos;d gained more appreciation for the influence of society on our so-called &quot;moral&quot; beliefs, and I couldn&apos;t conceive of what it would mean for anything to <em>really</em> matter. I wrote in my diary: &quot;The meaning of life is that there is no meaning&quot;.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<h2>Mid teens</h2>\n<p>Still, my interest in the fundamental questions about life persisted and at the age of 16 I discovered philosophy. Yes! This was it! I devoured the subject, spending nearly every spare moment of college in the library, filling ringbinders with notes and discussing philosophy with anyone who&apos;d humour me. As with religion, I struggled to understand how other people could go about their lives without giving these questions serious thought. &quot;Sure,&quot; I thought, &quot;philosophy is notorious for its lack of progress, but that&apos;s in part because its successes split off into new disciplines and in any case, don&apos;t you all at least want to try??&quot; I discovered Peter Singer&apos;s work and loved his rational approach to ethics. At some point I was walking home, and I still remember the place where I stopped as a thought hit me: &quot;Happiness is intrinsically good&quot;. There&apos;s little more I can say about that, but suffice it to say that from that moment on I have been a moral cognitivist. Perhaps nothing actually matters, but I think that contemplation of a particular feature of direct experience has allowed me to at least conceive of something really, ultimately &quot;mattering&quot;.</p>\n<p>Thanks to my new-found moral cognitivism built around what felt like an insight - happiness is intrinsically good - I focused my philosophy A-level on ethics where I could, and contributed to my sixth form&apos;s Activists&apos; Society.</p>\n<p>Beyond this &quot;insight&quot; and basic principles of rationality, I hadn&apos;t yet come across anything that seemed relevant to what was ultimately right or wrong (I wasn&apos;t thinking about useful day-to-day moral habits, intuitions or heuristics yet, reasoning that that could only come after I had some fundamental principles in place to draw from). Except perhaps my own rather extreme risk-aversion when it comes to my personal safety, and I wondered if I should conclude from that that our moral obligations are always with the worst-off. For a while, my top candidate ethical theories were classical utilitarianism and what I called &quot;bar consequentialism&quot; (until I found existing terms for similar ideas) - basically the idea that we should always focus entirely on trying to increase the happiness of whoever is suffering the most in the world. Utilitarianism didn&apos;t seem to put enough weight on avoiding suffering, and &quot;bar consequentialism&quot; seemed ridiculous for attributing no value to any increases in happiness or alleviation of suffering unless the subject was the worst-off person in existence, but any way of combining the two seemed arbitrary. Prioritarianism (whereby if you&apos;re suffering more then it becomes more important - but not exclusively important - to help you) showed some promise, but then I concluded that it was actually just the same as classical utilitarianism, and that I could just be a classical utilitarian who puts relatively large numbers on extreme suffering when it comes to judgements around exactly which experiences count as exactly which degrees of happiness/suffering. Nice. Utilitarianism it is. Job done.</p>\n<p>Not quite. I was still far from certain, and although I knew that a lifetime would not be long enough to find answers, I was going to do my best. I drew up a life plan that involved studying ethics through philosophy (and, to some extent, theology) as a career at the best university I could get into, publishing whatever I learnt and donating what I could.</p>\n<p>Alongside all my philosophising at sixth form I&apos;d been stepping up my altruistic behaviour. I thought most farm animals probably had happy lives even though some of them were awful, so it was fine to eat meat because otherwise those animals wouldn&apos;t exist at all. Then I realised one day that this was the wrong way to think about it - that the awful lives were <em>really</em> awful, and since we didn&apos;t really know where our meat came from, we shouldn&apos;t take the chance - and declared myself a vegetarian in the same breath. I donated to and volunteered for several charities. And I took over the Activists&apos; Society when no one else would (a habit picked up from math class where I felt despised for putting my hand up and getting the answer right, but I nevertheless wanted the lesson to progress...also a behaviour I&apos;d repeat a few times in the years to come). I learnt about perceived self-righteousness quickly, and we rebranded as the self-deprecating Save The World Club. I don&apos;t know why my altruistic motivation steadily increased over this period, but it did.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<h2>Late teens to present</h2>\n<p>I moved to Oxford for university and soon heard about this society that had just launched called Giving What We Can. What an awesome project! I attended a talk by the founder, Toby Ord, on vegetarianism and remember thinking, &quot;It&apos;s another Peter Singer&quot;.</p>\n<p>My mental health declined at Oxford (as I thought it probably would) and I sent emails to Peter Singer and Toby Ord asking for advice about whether to drop out, saying &quot;When other people are giving me advice they never factor in the &apos;ethics&apos; part anywhere near as much as I do so its not always that helpful.&quot; They made time for me and told me what I expected to hear, but I really valued the reassurance of hearing someone else say it. I dropped out.</p>\n<p>But I maintained my connection to Oxford. At the first Giving What We Can talk I attended I audibly gasped at the differences in cost-effectiveness estimates from the DCP2 report. I met one of the Felicifia admins at the talk and became an enthusiastic user; for some reason I&apos;d never thought to Google &quot;utilitarianism forum&quot;. It was there that I came across the wonderfully concise line: &quot;Utilitarianism and Nihilism are the only ethical systems that make any sense. If nihilism is true, it doesn&apos;t matter what I do, so I might as well assume it&apos;s false.&quot; (I&apos;m nowhere near that confident of course, but it&apos;s a nice summary of why I don&apos;t bother thinking about the possibility of nihilism any more.) There was some overlap between the Giving What We Can crew and the transhumanists/rationalists and one of the people in this overlap told me the <a href=\"https://nickbostrom.com/astronomical/waste.html\">astronomical waste</a> argument at a pub meet-up. I thought it was ridiculous. Then I wrote my undergraduate dissertation on why it was sensible. I kept up my co-leadership of the Oxford anti-genocide society for a while (so chosen because I figured the most effective ways to maximise happiness might still be to focus on the worst-off, and I couldn&apos;t think of anything worse), but eventually my co-leadership of the new Giving What We Can: Oxford society took over. I also launched another charitable student society at one point but eventually that too was handed on so that I could focus more on the emerging &quot;Effective Altruism&quot; movement. I couldn&apos;t get enough of it. In those early years I learnt so much, never failed to be excited at first meetings with like-minded souls, and attended several retreats where I experienced a very strong sense of community, of a beautiful, meaningful shared purpose and heartfelt mutual support to help each other get there.</p>\n<p>By the time we decided on the name Centre for Effective Altruism I had one of the fancy &quot;director&quot; titles (we students love our fancy titles) and was working on community support for Giving What We Can. When The Life You Can Save needed new leadership, I stepped up, and when my mental health deteriorated, I stepped down. I then spent three years in jobs in which my priorities were (i) my mental health and (ii) exploration of a large variety of industries and people. Then last summer I was able to take some months off to reevaluate and, feeling more mentally healthy and realising that I&apos;d learnt relatively little of value in my three years &quot;off&quot;, I decided to try EA community-building full-time again.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p>This is one version of my story. It&apos;s already a bit more exposure than I really feel comfortable with at the moment, so I&apos;ve left out a lot of the embarrassing mistakes I made (nearly all around being too confident and/or emotional in my judgements) and a lot of the things I found difficult. But I hope that you find something useful in it, that you enjoy reflecting on your own story, and that you remember that we each have a story riddled with personal mistakes and challenges but united in one belief: <a href=\"https://secularsolstice.com\">Tomorrow can be brighter than today</a>[2].</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<h1>Final notes</h1>\n<p>Readers, please remember to keep in mind that these stories are not who we are.

My hope is that this might also serve as a kind of &quot;EA gratitude journalling&quot; - that reflecting on your early days in EA and what you loved or grew to love about it will help generate positive feelings of nostalgia, appreciation and camaraderie. At the time of writing, I sense that tensions are particularly high in our community. I of course have my own thoughts on what mistakes particular people/organisations have made or are making, and on whose judgment or honesty I most trust on which matters, and I think it is often extremely important to discuss them. And often emotion is in the driving seat when I&apos;m discussing my latest thoughts, despite my self-deception to the contrary, we&apos;re all human. But I suspect that an extra dose of empathy and mutual appreciation would be useful for the disagreements being aired right now and I hope that taking part in this exercise, even privately, will help.&#xA0;<a href=\"https://blog.jaibot.com\">Almost no one is evil.

To take an obvious example, if someone was very pro-Fair Trade and started saying EA was all about Fair Trade, this would not really be representative of what most EAs think (even if this person was convinced that Fair Trade was the best cause within the EA framework). Naturally, in a movement as large as the EA movement, there remains a diversity of viewpoints, but, nonetheless, I think it&apos;s fairly easy for experienced EAs to have a sense of what is a common EA view, and what is not (although, people can definitely be affected by peer group pressure and city selection in creating a bubble). There have been a lot of implicit and explicit conflicts around this issue and there are different possible solutions to dealing with it.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>First, some examples of clear problems with representativeness.&#xA0;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The EA Handbook</li>\n<li>EA Global</li>\n<li>Funding gaps</li>\n<li>EA chapter building</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><strong>The EA Handbook</strong></h2>\n<p>The EA Handbook was one of the most public examples of the problem at hand: you can look at the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/effective.altruists/permalink/1750780338311649/\">facebook comments</a> and <a href=\"/ea/1np/announcing_the_effective_altruism_handbook_2nd/\">EA Forum comments</a> to get a sense of what people have said. If I had to summarize a group of people&#x2019;s concerns, it would have to do with representativeness. As was put it in one of the comments:&#xA0;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&#x201C;I don&apos;t feel like this handbook represents EA as I understand it. By page count, AI is 45.7% of the entire causes sections. And as Catherine Low pointed out, in both the animal and the global poverty articles (which I didn&apos;t count toward the page count), more than half the article was dedicated to why we might not choose this cause area, with much of that space also focused on far-future of humanity. I&apos;d find it hard for anyone to read this and not take away that the community consensus is that AI risk is clearly the most important thing to focus on.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I personally think people would not have reacted so strongly to the Handbook if it had not seemed like being part of a bigger trend, one I hope to crystallize in this blog post.</p>\n<h2><strong>EA Global</strong></h2>\n<p>EA Global is an area that is pretty public and pretty numerically measurable. If you look at all the talks given in 2018 by their cause area, they end up looking like 3 hours worth of global poverty, 4.5 hours animal welfare talks, and 11.5 hours of x-risk. This is not counting the meta talks that could have been about any cause area but were often effectively x-risk-related (e.g. 80,000 Hours&#x2019; career advice). This is also counting the &#x201C;far future animal welfare talks&#x201D; as normal animal welfare talks. You can also split it up as near future cause areas, with 5.5 hours dedicated on them, vs far future cause areas, with 13.5 hours spent on those.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>This concern has been true for the last few EAGs and it&#x2019;s getting more noticeable over time. Part of the reason I only go to every 2nd EAG, and why many of the people I would describe as leaders in EA poverty do not go at all, is due to the lack of representation, and thus the lack of draw of EAs who would want to talk about other causes. This is a self-perpetuating problem as well, since if fewer EAs go the events they become intrinsically less and less friendly towards the EAs of that cause area. After a couple years, you could even do a survey and say &#x201C;well, the average attender of EAG thinks X cause is of the highest impact&#x201D;, but that would only be true because of everyone with different views dropping out over time due to frustration and a feeling of disconnection. This is another issue I have talked about with a lot of involved EAs, and is part of the reason there is interest in <a href=\"http://easummit2018.webflow.io/\">a different EA related conference</a>.</p>\n<h2>Funding Gaps</h2>\n<p>Details on funding gaps can be found <a href=\"/ea/1ok/ea_doesnt_have_a_talent_gap_different_causes_have/\">here</a>. Generally, however, claiming that &#x201C;the EA movement is not largely funding constrained&#x201D; is another example of a general trend of implying that the particular things that are representative of particular groups of EAs ultimately represent the movement as a whole.</p>\n<p>Saying that &#x201C;the far future is funding-filled and thus, if you care about it, you should not like earning-to-give as much&#x201D; is more honest and true than claims along the lines of &#x201C;the whole EA movement is funding-filled&#x201D;.</p>\n<h2>EA Chapter Building</h2>\n<p>The final example is more subtle to quantify, but it&#x2019;s also one I have heard about from quite a few different sources. EA chapter building is currently fairly tightly controlled and focused heavily on the creation of far future and AI-focused EAs. Again, if an organization is genuine about this, that is one thing, but I feel as though the average EA (unless they have had direct experience with trying to run a chapter) would guess that groups are generally discussing all cause areas and are getting supported similarly, regardless of focus.</p>\n<p>While these are not the only examples, I feel they are sadly enough to point at a more overarching trend.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>I would also like to include some areas where I feel this has not happened. Some good examples:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>EA Forum</li>\n<li>EA Facebook jobs</li>\n<li>EA Wikipedia</li>\n<li>Doing Good Better</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The EA Forum is surprisingly diverse, and the current karma system does not seem to consistently favour one cause area or EA organization over another. <a href=\"/ea/1qv/ea_forum_20_initial_announcement/\">As stated in this post</a>, it&#x2019;s true that frequent forum users tend to have a diversity of views. This could change in the future, given the <a href=\"/ea/1qv/ea_forum_20_initial_announcement/\">upcoming changes</a>, but currently, I see this medium as one of the less controlled systems within the EA.</p>\n<p>The EA Facebook jobs group has helped a lot of people (including many of the staff currently working at EA organisations) find jobs from a wide range of EA-related organizations. If you take a sampling of the job ads, they tend to be disperse and more representative of the different cause areas.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_altruism\">EA Wikipedia page</a> currently shows all three causes and concepts that most EAs would broadly agree with as core to the movement and representative of those within.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>Doing Good Better, much like the Wikipedia page, does not hold an aggressively single cause focus throughout the book. Instead, it covers classic EA and issues that almost all would agree with.&#xA0;&#xA0;</p>\n<h2>How do we know what is representative?&#xA0;</h2>\n<p>Representativeness is defined as &#x201C;typical of a class, group, or body of opinion&#x201D;. So the representativeness of the EA movement would be expressed via what is typical of many EAs within the movement. This would, ideally be determined via a random sample that hits a large percentage of the EA movement. For example, through the EA survey or by gathering the perspective of everyone who has signed up to the EA Forum. Both of these would hit a very large percentage of the EA movement relative to more informal measures.</p>\n<h2>What is representative of EA leaders?</h2>\n<p>One of the responses against having a representative sample is that perhaps there are EAs who are more well-informed than others. To take a more objective criteria, perhaps the average EA who has been involved in the EA movement for 5 years or more is more informed than the average EA who has been involved for 5 days. I think there are ways to go about determining things like this from more aggregate data (for example, duration of involvement, or the percentage donated, might both correlate with more involved EAs). Perhaps even do a survey which makes sure to sample every organization that over 50% of the broader EA community thinks of as of an &#x201C;EA organization&#x201D;.</p>\n<p>While this post does not aim to determine the &#x201C;perfect&#x201D; way to sample EAs or EA leaders, it does aim to point in the right direction in the face of the numerous issues with sampling EAs. Clearly, a survey of only the EA leaders within my city (or any other specific location) would be critically biased, as would be one with a disproportional focus on a particular organization. Another unrepresentative sample might be derived from among &#x201C;EAG leaders&#x201D;, as the leaders are chosen by a single organization and generally hold that organization&#x2019;s cause as salient. This issue is worth another post altogether.&#xA0; &#xA0;&#xA0;</p>\n<h2>Possible solutions</h2>\n<p><strong>Have a low but consistent bar for representativeness</strong>, allowing multiple groups to put forward competing presentations of EA. For example, anyone can make an EA handbook that&#x2019;s heavily focused on a single cause area and call it an EA handbook.</p>\n<p><em>Pros</em> - This solution is fairly easy to implement, and allows a wide variety of ideas to co-exist and flourish. Things will naturally get more popular if they represent the EAs better as they will be shared more throughout the movement.&#xA0;&#xA0;</p>\n<p><em>Cons </em>- Leaves the movement pretty vulnerable to co-option and misrepresentation (e.g. an EA Fair Trade handbook),which could harm movement building/newer people&#x2019;s views of EA.&#xA0;</p>\n<p><strong>Have a high and consistent bar for representativeness.</strong> For example, if something is branded in a way that suggests that it is representative of EA, it exhibits at least 20% of each cause area (x-risk, AR, poverty) and does not clearly pitch or favour a single organization or approach. Alternatively, some kind of a more formal system, based off objective measures from the community, could be installed.&#xA0;</p>\n<p><em>Pros</em> - Does not make EA easy to co-opt, and makes sure that the most seen EA content gives appropriate representation to different ideas.</p>\n<p><em>Cons</em> - Ratios and exact numbers would be hard to calculate and get a sense of. They would also change over time (e.g. if a new cause got added).&#xA0;&#xA0;</p>\n<p><strong>Community-building organizations could strive for cause indifference.</strong> For example, current EA is built via a few different movement-building organizations. A case could be made that organizations focused specifically on movement-building should strive to be representative or cause indifferent. One of the ways they could do this is through cross-organization consultation before hosting events or publishing materials meant to represent the movement as a whole.&#xA0;</p>\n<p><em>Pros</em> - Reduces the odds of duplicating movement outreach work (e.g. AI EA chapters and poverty EA chapters). Increases the odds that long term the EA movement will be cause diverse, leading to higher odds of finding Cause X, a cause that&#x2019;s better than currently existing cause areas that we haven&#x2019;t discovered yet.</p>\n<p><em>Cons</em> - Many of the most established EA organisations have a cause focus of some sort. Would be hard to enforce, but could nonetheless be an ideal worth striving towards.&#xA0; &#xA0;</p></body></html>", "user": {"username": "Joey"}}, {"_id": "qYbqX3jX4JnTtHA5f", "title": "Leverage Research: reviewing the basic facts", "postedAt": "2018-08-03T05:19:43.030Z", "htmlBody": "<html><body><h2><strong>Resources spent</strong></h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Leverage Research has now existed for over 7.5 years<sup>1</sup></li>\n<li>Since 2011,&#xA0;it has consumed over 100 person-years of human capital.</li>\n<li>From 2012-16, Leverage Research spent&#xA0;$2.02 million, and the associated Institute for Philosophical Research spent $310k.<sup>23</sup></li>\n</ul>\n<h2><strong>Outputs</strong></h2>\n<p>Some of the&#xA0;larger&#xA0;outputs of Leverage Research include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Work on Connection Theory:&#xA0;although this does not include the&#xA0;initial creation&#xA0;of the theory itself, which was done&#xA0;by Geoff Anders&#xA0;prior to&#xA0;founding Leverage Research</li>\n<li>Contributions to productivity of altruists via the application of&#xA0;psychological theories including Connection Theory</li>\n<li>Intellectual contributions to the effective altruism community: including early work on cause prioritisation and risks to the movement.</li>\n<li>Intellectual contributions to the rationality community: including CFAR&#x2019;s class on goal factoring</li>\n<li>The EA Summits in 2013-14: The EA summit is a precursor to EA Global, which is being revived in 2018</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Its website also has seven blog posts.<sup>4</sup></p>\n<h2><strong>Recruitment&#xA0;Transparency</strong></h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Leverage Research&#xA0;previous organized the Pareto Fellowship in collaboration with another effective altruism organization.

Now that we have more capacity, we are looking for effective altruists and existing local EA groups that might be interested in starting and running their own One for the World chapter in their non-EA communities. We provide an infrastructure of resources and established practices that try to make it easier to get others involved in effective giving through our 1% pledge system.

We encourage individuals to pledge at least 1% of their income to effective global poverty charities in our portfolio (which is based on recommendations by The Life You Can Save and GiveWell). Our members can choose to donate to a portfolio of charities (which we update once a year), or to specific charities in our wider portfolio. We try to make these donations as convenient as possible, by providing an easy-to-use platform (see our website, </span><a href=\"https://www.1fortheworld.org/\"><span>1fortheworld.org</span></a><span>) which allows donors to choose a date in the future at which their regular donations will start, a tool which we have found to be particularly effective for students. </span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>We are comprised of chapters, currently 15, that create a community of effective givers in their local peer community. Chapters are headed by a board, usually 4-10 members in size, and aided by a number of &#x2018;Student Ambassadors&#x2019; that actively recruit members. By running community events (such as guest speakers or giving games), developing personal connections, and hosting our &apos;Pledge Weeks&apos;, our chapters educate their communities and push action through taking the pledge. Our hypothesis is that our lower ask (at least 1% of income) and focus on global poverty increases engagement with people who are interested in EA, broadly agree with its principles, but have yet to engage with the EA community in a meaningful manner.</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>Proof of concept: our current chapters</span></p>\n<p><span>One for the World was founded in 2014 by two Wharton MBAs who wanted to take action on the large potential for good through giving to effective charities. Since then, we have grown significantly and now have 15 distinct chapters at universities around the country. Our first chapter at Wharton provides a great example of the potential One for the World can unlock. Over the past three years, we have had 8-13% penetration in the graduating MBA class and are generating recurring annual pledges of about $80,000 per cohort. We think that a significant proportion of the value of these pledges is yet to be realised, as our members&apos; careers progress and their businesses grow. Much of the Wharton classes have not previously been exposed to effective altruism and an introduction to One for the World is their first exposure to these ideas. Nonetheless, our chapter has shown the potential that exists to make an impact in a community that has not traditionally been reached by local EA groups, by introducing the concepts of effective giving and providing convenient methods of action. </span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>Our expansion chapters have provided more evidence of this potential. Three of our fastest growing chapters, Columbia, Villanova, and Stanford Graduate School of Business, have attracted 50-100 new donors in the past year after only having been established in fall of 2017 at the earliest. Stanford GSB has had fairly immediate success: the chapter raised more than $25,000 in their first semester. Our experiences with existing chapters have taught us invaluable lessons in introducing effective giving to diverse communities while exposing the potential impact available with our system.</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>What we don&#x2019;t do</span></p>\n<p><span>We are not designed to replace existing local EA groups or giving opportunities. For instance, the Giving What We Can pledge involves giving 10% of your income to effective charities; clearly a much larger impact than our 1% starting point. Similarly, we believe that the EA community has very strong foundations in its use of local groups, and we want to complement existing resources and practices. Our goal as an organization is to expand the reach of effective altruism to individuals who have not yet engaged, and to complement existing efforts to deepen engagement among those &#xA0;who are most aligned with EA values. </span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>Our Value Added</span></p>\n<p><span>In comparison to other giving outlets for EA-minded individuals, such as Giving What We Can&#x2019;s 10% pledge, we act as a low-barrier, convenient method of introducing newcomers to effective giving. Our system is designed to make effective giving a regular part of diverse communities, even for those initially hesitant to strong EA principles. We have established proof of concept by establishing effective giving as a significant part of communities that one might consider stereotypically unlikely to engage with and support EA. We provide all chapters with one-on-one support with members of our experienced advisory board in addition to providing helpful contacts and connections with other chapter leads. New chapter leads are able to draw from past experiences of established chapters and receive existing materials, resources, and funding. Our chapters are working to establish a nationwide presence and we have a goal of making effective giving a part of lives in a much broader cross section of society.</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span><strong><span>Get in touch</span></strong></span></p>\n<p><span>If you&#x2019;re interested in our approach, would like to encourage large numbers of people to engage with EA and help raise money for effective global poverty charities, please get in touch &#xA0;via the form at: </span><a href=\"https://www.1fortheworld.org/start-a-chapter/\"><span>https://www.1fortheworld.org/start-a-chapter/</span></a></p></body></html>", "user": {"username": "rossaokod"}}, {"_id": "YuwXeASg3aeiPdLdh", "title": "A Critical Perspective on Maximizing Happiness", "postedAt": "2018-08-01T21:17:15.684Z", "htmlBody": "<html><body><p>I know of two substantially different approaches to deal with the difficulties of the world. The stoic approach is about making oneself accept the things how they are, no matter how horrible, painful and frightening. Acceptance is a rather leveled emotional state, unlike happiness which is a one sided&#xA0;set of emotions. Positive psychology is about creating positive feelings through positive thinking (- instead of realistic thinking?), optimism, hopeful thinking and generally attention control towards positive things.</p>\n<p>I think in what sense positive psychology can be useful, is as a toolbox to heal mental&#xA0;weaknesses by balancing a lot of negative emotions with positive ones. However, I don&apos;t consider the positive focus and constant happiness as a reasonable or healthy state, but as an intermediate stage, as for some people training to handle and accept all the horrible painful and fearful parts of reality is a very challenging procedure that requires lot of strength. Happiness, I think, is not an appropriate or sustainable state to have in the world that we currently live in. It is a state for moments and parts of life to encourage hard work towards good things. But the state of happiness has the down side of getting addictive and lose the ability to handle unhappy states. In order to not <span>freak out every time the next horrible thing is happening one needs to learn to accept the&#xA0;</span>consistency of change and general lack of control.</p>\n<p>You may as well say that stoic thinking could be problematic, since when you accept things how they are you lose drive working towards better things. I do see that risk, and even have several friends who are thinking like that.

It was as follows:<br><br></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Hello. In the last few months I&apos;ve noticed some&#xA0;<span>EA</span>&#xA0;<span>community</span>&#xA0;members have expressed concern with a relative lack of activity since the&#xA0;<span>EA&#xA0;</span><span>Funds</span>&#xA0;started. Ben West posted about it here in the &apos;<span>Effective</span>&#xA0;<span>Altruism</span>&apos; Facebook group.&#xA0;<br><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/effective.altruists/permalink/1606722932717391/\">https://www.facebook.com/<wbr>groups/<span>effective</span>.altruists/<wbr>permalink/1606722932717391/</a></p>\n<p>At the time, Peter Hurford estimated the amount which had been allocated from each of the&#xA0;<span>EA</span>&#xA0;<span>Funds</span>&#xA0;in this comment (<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/effective.altruists/permalink/1606722932717391/?comment_id=1607047222684962&amp;comment_tracking=%7B%22tn%22%3A%22R9%22%7D\">https://www.facebook.com/<wbr>groups/<span>effective</span>.altruists/<wbr>permalink/1606722932717391/?<wbr>comment_id=1607047222684962&amp;<wbr>comment_tracking=%7B%22tn%22%<wbr>3A%22R9%22%7D</a>). Of course Marek Duda and Sam Deere let everyone know the&#xA0;<span>EA</span>&#xA0;<span>Funds</span>&#xA0;website had been updated with the amounts donated to the fund, and how they have been allocated up to the most recent date.</p>\n<p>But later at the end of January Henry Stanley posted about how much money remain unallocated from the&#xA0;<span>EA</span>&#xA0;<span>Funds</span>. Henry pointed out the Animal Welfare Fund frequently makes many small grants (<a href=\"/ea/1k9/ea_funds_hands_out_money_very_infrequently_should/\">http://<span>effective</span>-<span>altruism</span>.<wbr>com/<span>ea</span>/1k9/ea_funds_hands_out_<wbr>money_very_infrequently_<wbr>should/</a>). This is corroborated by this comment from Lewis Bollard on Ben&apos;s post from September.&#xA0;<br>Elie Hassenfeld, grant manager for the Global Development Fund, also provided a public update on his current plans for allocation, and request for feedback from donors on the&#xA0;<span>EA</span>&#xA0;Forum as well (<a href=\"/ea/1k9/ea_funds_hands_out_money_very_infrequently_should/d8o\">http://<span>effective</span>-<span>altruism</span>.<wbr>com/<span>ea</span>/1k9/ea_funds_hands_out_<wbr>money_very_infrequently_<wbr>should/d8o</a>), on Henry&apos;s&#xA0;<span>EA</span>&#xA0;Forum post.</p>\n<p>In neither of these posts has there been any updates from Nick Beckstead, grant manager for both the Long-Term&#xA0;<span>Future</span>&#xA0;and&#xA0;<span>EA</span>&#xA0;<span>Community</span><span>Funds</span>. From the&#xA0;<span>EA</span>&#xA0;<span>Funds</span>&#xA0;website, the latest update from each of these&#xA0;<span>funds</span>&#xA0;as of December 15, 2017 is they&apos;ve each only made one grant.&#xA0;<br><a href=\"https://app.effectivealtruism.org/funds/far-future\">https://app.effectivealtruism.<wbr>org/<span>funds</span>/<span>far</span>-<span>future</span></a>&#xA0;<br><a href=\"https://app.effectivealtruism.org/funds/ea-community\">https://app.effectivealtruism.<wbr>org/<span>funds</span>/<span>ea</span>-<span>community</span></a></p>\n<p>While I&apos;m not a donor to either of these or any of the&#xA0;<span>EA</span>&#xA0;<span>Funds</span>&#xA0;at present, as an&#xA0;<span>EA</span>&#xA0;<span>community</span>&#xA0;member I&apos;m curious if:&#xA0;<br>1) There have been grants from either the Long-Term&#xA0;<span>Future</span>&#xA0;or&#xA0;<span>EA</span>&#xA0;<span>Community</span>&#xA0;<span>Funds</span>&#xA0;since December?&#xA0;<br>2) Can the&#xA0;<span>EA</span>&#xA0;<span>community</span>&#xA0;expect a public update about allocations from or&#xA0;<span>future</span>&#xA0;plans for either of these&#xA0;<span>Funds</span>, from Nick Beckstead, in the near&#xA0;<span>future</span>?</p>\n<p>Thanks for your time,&#xA0;<br>Evan</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>At the time, JP responded no grants from either of these funds had been made since the Community Fund grant was completed in January. He also stated the CEA was working on plans for increased grants, updates and transparency, which he expected to be out sometime before July. That was in April. As of me writing this, it is 22 July 2018.<br><br>On Henry&apos;s last post from April regarding how to <a href=\"/ea/1k9/ea_funds_hands_out_money_very_infrequently_should/\">improve the EA Funds</a>, Marek Duda commented with the following response:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Hello, speaking in my capacity as the person responsible for EA Funds at CEA:</p>\n<p>Many of the things Henry points out seem valid, and we are working on addressing these and improving the Funds in a number ways. We are building a Funds &#x2018;dashboard&#x2019; to show balances in near real time, looking into the best ways of not holding the balances in cash, and thinking about other ways to get more value out of the platform.</p>\n<p>We expect to publish a post with more detail on our approach in the next couple of weeks. Feel free to reach out to me personally if you wish to discuss or provide input on the process</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>No such updates have been made. Whether it&apos;s been privately or on the Effective Altruism Forum,&#xA0;ranging from a couple weeks to a few months, estimates from the CEA regarding updates from the EA Funds cannot be relied upon. According to data publicly available on the EA Funds website, each of the&#xA0;Long-Term Future&#xA0;and EA Community Funds have made a single grant: <a href=\"https://app.effectivealtruism.org/funds/far-future/payouts/OzIQqsVacUKw0kEuaUGgI\">~$14k to the Berkeley Existential Risk Initiative</a>, and <a href=\"https://app.effectivealtruism.org/funds/ea-community/payouts/1EjFHdfk3GmIeIaqquWgQI\">~$83k to EA Sweden</a>, respectively. As of April 2018, over $1 million total is available for grants from the <a href=\"https://app.effectivealtruism.org/funds/far-future\">Long-Term Future Fund</a>, and almost $600k from the <a href=\"https://app.effectivealtruism.org/funds/ea-community\">EA Community Fund</a>. Here is the most recent update from both these funds from Nick Beckstead, grant manager for both funds, and a Program Officer for Global Catastrophic Risks at the Open Philanthropy Project (Open Phil).</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I am giving an update on my grantmaking with the EA Funds. I&apos;m giving it now because the size of funds available has increased and some people have expressed concern about infrequent grantmaking and updates.</p>\n<p>I am currently a few months behind the (not publicly stated) schedule that I originally intended for disbursing most of the funds. However, I am planning to recommend grants that use up all available funds at my disposal under EA Funds by July 1st 2018 at the latest, and probably in the next month. The grants I plan to make are currently under consideration, but I will wait to announce them publicly. I plan for these grants to go to organizations with which I am familiar and have supported in the past.</p>\n<p>Here are some updates regarding my plans for making grants with these funds and giving updates in the future:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<blockquote><span>I am not reviewing unsolicited proposals to fund new, small projects</span>&#xA0;(e.g. with 1-2 people working for 1-2 years) with these funds because, regrettably, I lack the time necessary to adequately vet them due to other responsibilities I have. I believe a reasonable degree of vetting is important for the EA ecosystem. The concern is less that the funds will be wasted without such vetting, and more that not-properly-vetted new projects could undermine success by (i) being suboptimal representatives of important ideas, (ii) after being unsuccessful, sticking around too long and preventing better projects from taking their places, and/or (iii) causing other forms of harm. Given these constraints and the fact that I think grants to existing organizations have good expected returns, I rarely give substantial consideration to unsolicited proposals that come without a strong recommendation from a trusted source.</blockquote>\n</li>\n<li>\n<blockquote><span>I am encouraging those seeking funding for small projects to seek support via EA Grants</span>, rather than through Open Phil or EA Funds. EA Grants will have more time to vet such projects. I believe this is the most natural division of labor given the funding, relationships, and other priorities that each of us has.</blockquote>\n</li>\n<li>\n<blockquote><span>I largely expect to use these funds to support organizations with which I am familiar and have supported in the past</span>, though I may also fund new initiatives that I have determined to be valuable but are not a good fit for Open Phil.</blockquote>\n</li>\n<li>\n<blockquote><span>I expect that I will use the EA Funds about once per year to make grants and update supporters</span>, and that I will either (a) use a substantial majority of the available funds when I do so, or (b) write an update saying that I have explicitly decided to hold the funds at the time. I plan to do this, rather than on a more frequent schedule, because Open Phil funds most other types of grants that I recommend, Open Phil grantmaking constitutes the vast majority of my overall grantmaking, and this grantmaking via EA Funds also requires significant attention each time grants are made. I am not yet sure at what time I expect to do this in 2019 (after granting out funds this year).&#xA0;&#xA0;</blockquote>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Visiting the <a href=\"https://www.effectivealtruism.org/grants/\">EA Grants website</a>, it states applications are currently closed, and there is no indication of when another application or funding round will begin. Thus, it is not clear how those seeking funding for small projects should seek support from the EA Grants or the CEA. Much of the rationale on the EA Funds webpage is based on Nick&apos;s long track record of making grants to EA organizations from before the EA Funds existed. This is not itself a track record for either the Long-Term Future or EA Community Funds. On the webpage for the Long-Term Future Fund, under the heading &quot;why might you choose not to donate to this fund?&quot;, it states:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>First,&#xA0;<em>donors who prefer to support established organizations</em>. The fund manager has a track record of funding newer organizations and this trend is likely to continue, provided that promising opportunities continue to exist.</p>\n<p>Second,&#xA0;<em>donors who are pessimistic about the room for more funding available in the area</em>. The Open Philanthropy Project has&#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.openphilanthropy.org/focus/global-catastrophic-risks\">made global catastrophic risk reduction a major focus area</a>&#xA0;and may fund many of the opportunities that the fund manager would find promising. The fund manager has&#xA0;<a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2016/12/09/staff-members-personal-donations-giving-season-2016/\">noted</a>&#xA0;that &#x201C;with Open Phil as a funder in this space it has been harder to find opportunities that are as promising and neglected as we were able to find previously.&#x201D;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>&#xA0;<span>From the webpage for the EA Community Fund, under the heading &quot;Why donate to this fund?&quot;, it states:</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This fund supports building and strengthening the capabilities of people and organizations trying to do good in a cause-neutral, outcome-oriented way &#x2014; that is, the effective altruism community (broadly construed). When successful, such investments yield a flexible multiplier on the next most high-priority cause and allow us to build up resources which will hopefully be flexible enough to support the causes and opportunities that are later found to be the most promising. Donors should keep in mind that the multiplier can be somewhat delayed and that funding successes in object-level areas can also yield multipliers of their own.</p>\n<p>Building the community of people working on effective causes is especially important for those who expect their opinions about the highest-priority areas to change a great deal. If the effective altruism community grows, that growth builds up general capabilities to take the best opportunities as they are discovered. It seems uncrowded, because it&#x2019;s a new cause and there appear to be good opportunities available. It seems tractable because there are definite advocacy opportunities which have worked in the past and whose success can be measured. Examples include: encouraging people to join&#xA0;<a href=\"https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/\">Giving What We Can</a>&#xA0;or take the&#xA0;<a href=\"https://founderspledge.com/\">Founders Pledge</a>. More direct evidence for effectiveness comes from the strong success to date of many of the projects in the area, like&#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/\">GiveWell</a>.</p>\n<p>Moreover, in the recent past, investing in promoting effective altruism has resulted in significantly more resources being invested in the highest-priority areas than would have occurred through direct donations. For instance, for every US $1 invested in&#xA0;<a href=\"https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/impact/\">Giving What We Can</a>, at least $6 have been moved to high-priority interventions. Donors should note that the marginal return on funds is less clear for many of these opportunities, with some factors pointing to a higher number and some factors pointing to a lower number. Additionally, the area may be important because it&#x2019;s a brand new area where there is much to learn, and we expect further work to have high value of information.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p>Further down the page, under the heading &quot;Why might you choose not to donate to this fund?&quot;, it states two of the same reasons why someone would opt not to donate to the&#xA0;Long-Term Future&#xA0;Fund:<br><br></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>First, if donors prefer donations to established organizations over donations to emerging organizations, then this fund might not meet these preferences. The fund manager has a track record of funding newer organizations, and this trend is likely to continue as long as promising opportunities continue to exist.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p>Second, supporters of movement building might choose not to donate through the EA Community Building Fund if they are pessimistic about the room for more funding available in the movement building space. The Open Philanthropy Project&#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.openphilanthropy.org/focus/other-areas\">recently announced</a>&#xA0;that it would start considering grants in effective altruism and that this effort would be lead by Nick Beckstead, the EA Community Building Fund manager. Nick has noted that following Open Philanthropy&apos;s involvement in this area, there are now fewer promising but neglected donation opportunities here. (<a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2016/12/09/staff-members-personal-donations-giving-season-2016/\">Source</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So, the considerations the CEA gives for why one might donate to the Long-Term Future and EA Community Funds, to support emerging organizations over existing ones; and because they expect there is much more room for funding in these focus areas, are contradicted by the fund manager. Nick is seeking to primarily make grants to existing organizations over emerging ones, and isn&apos;t taking much time to research grant opportunities in these focus areas through the EA Funds. Because Nick&apos;s grant recommendations are usually filled by the Open Philanthropy Project, and investigating further grants would take significant amounts of time from that work, grantmaking through the EA Funds at present is not as much a priority. No reason is given for the different management styles of the&#xA0;Long-Term Future and EA Community Funds by Nick Beckstead as an Open Phil program officer; and the respective management of the Global Health &amp; Development, and Animal Welfare Funds by Elie Hassenfeld and Lewis Bollard, also program officers at Open Phil. Both Elie and Lewis have been directly responsive to the community regarding transparency for each of the funds they manage here on the EA Forum. They have also followed through on making grants and updating donors to their respective funds at least every few months. Having started in 2017, with Nick ambiguously stating grants may be made in 2019, the vast majority of the&#xA0;Long-Term Future and EA Community Funds will have been held for almost two years without clear reasons as to why this should be the case.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p>When making suggestions for how to improve the EA Funds, Henry Stanley listed the following concerns:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<blockquote><strong>The funds hand out money very infrequently</strong>, and hold onto money for long periods of time. This erodes the value of the fund through time discounting. EA orgs have stated that they value donations in a year&apos;s time at a 12% discount to receiving them now[1], so this represents a substantial cost.</blockquote>\n</li>\n<li>\n<blockquote><strong>The funds hold their money as cash</strong>, forgoing any potential interest the money could earn.</blockquote>\n</li>\n<li>\n<blockquote><strong>There is no schedule as to when the money will be handed out</strong>. This lack of transparency is troubling, and prevents donors making informed choices (e.g. to give directly to charities instead of waiting).</blockquote>\n</li>\n<li>\n<blockquote>(a weaker objection) As the funds hold onto donations for so long,&#xA0;<strong>the chances of the fund manager&apos;s and donors&#x2019; intentions drifting apart is high</strong>.</blockquote>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<p>The email I received from the CEA regarding updates to the grants and transparency of the Long-Term Future and EA Community Funds is only accurate insofar as the update has been that will be no schedule for grantmaking, and for the indefinite future there will not be an increase in transparency. The updates from Nick regarding these funds is they will continue to hand out money infrequently, and no schedule will be provided for when grants will be made. It appears through no fault of their own, other staff at the CEA cannot to concerned community members updates regarding these two funds, because internally within the organization no updates have been provided to them. Nonetheless, whether it&apos;s from the CEA or Nick Beckstead, to address concerns regarding transparency and accountability of fiscal management in effective altruism by indicating those funds will not be managed with transparency or accountability is unacceptable. That is no transparency or accountability at all. All the while, the EA Funds have been taking in more donations from effective altruists who very likely would have counterfactually donated to nascent EA projects in need of funding to get off the ground. At the time of Henry&apos;s post in April, these were the amounts in these two funds remaining unallocated.<br><br></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Long-Term Future: $348,167 [95%]</li>\n<li>EA Community: $206,271 [71%]</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As stated above, the Long-Term Future Fund now has over $1 million unallocated, and the EA Community Fund $600k. Whether its viewed as hundreds of thousands of dollars more, or an increase in nearly 200% in the size of funds, in the last several months, these funds have ballooned in size while quietly going back on the impression effective altruists were given on what the funds would be used for. On Henry&apos;s first post concerning the infrequent grants from (at the time, all) the EA Funds, I commented the following:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I&apos;ve received feedback from multiple points in the community the EA Funds haven&apos;t been as responsive in as timely or as professional a manner as some would prefer. It appears a factor for this is that the fund managers are all program officers at the Open Philanthropy Project, which is a job which from the fund managers&apos; perspective is most of the time more crucial than anything that can be done with the EA Funds. Thus, doing a more than full-time work-equivalent(?... I don&apos;t know how much Open Phil staff work each week) may mean management of the EA Funds gets overlooked. Ben West also made a recent post in the &apos;Effective Altruism&apos; Facebook group asking about the EA Funds, and the response from the Centre for Effective Altruism (CEA) was they hadn&apos;t had a chance to update the EA Funds webpage with data on what grants had been made in recent months.</p>\n<p>Given that at the current level of funding, the EA Funds aren&apos;t being mismanaged, but rather are being more neglected than donors and effective altruists would like, I&apos;d say it might already be time to assign more managers to the fund. Picking Open Phil program officers to run the funds was the best bet for the community to begin with, as they had the best reputation for acumen going in, but if in practice in turns out Nick, Elie and Lewis only have enough time to manage grants at Open Phil (most of the time), it&apos;s only fair to donors CEA assign more fund managers to the fund. What&apos;s more, I wouldn&apos;t want the attention of Open Phil program officers to be any more divided than it need be, as I consider their work more important than the management of the EA Funds as is.</p>\n<p>If the apparent lack of community engagement regarding the EA Funds is on the part of the CEA team responsible to keep the webpage updated, as their time may also be divided and dedicated to more important CEA projects than the EA Funds at any given point in time, that needs to be addressed. I understand the pressures of affording enough money to project management it gets done very effectively, while as an effective non-profit not wanting to let overhead expand too much and result in inefficient uses of donor money. I think if that&apos;s the case for CEA staff dividing their time between EA Funds and more active projects, it&apos;d be appropriate for the CEA to hire a dedicated communications manager for the the EA Funds overall, and/or someone who will update the webpage with greater frequency. This could probably be done at 1 full-time equivalent additional staff hire or less. If it&apos;s not a single new position at the CEA, a part-time equivalent CEA staffer could have their responsibilities extended to ensuring there&apos;s a direct channel between the EA Funds and the EA community.</p>\n<p>In the scope of things, such as the money moved through EA overall, EA Funds management may seem a minor issue. Given it&apos;s impact on values integral to EA, like transparency and accountability, as well as ensuring high-trust engagement between EA donors and EA organizations, options like I&apos;ve listed out above seem important to implement. If not, overall, I&apos;d think there&apos;s greater need for adding external oversight to ensure anything is being done with the EA Funds.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><span><span>It&apos;s clear compared to how the Global Health &amp; Development and Animal Welfare Funds are being manged, the Long-Term and EA Community Funds are being seriously neglected. On top of this, the CEA has made clear for a long time now their cause selection within EA is movement-building; the long-term future; and existential risk reduction. So it should be especially concerning to effective altruists who share this cause selection and have donated to these funds that they&apos;are apparently undermining the integrity of the CEA&apos;s own goals. The juxtaposition of the stagnancy of the Long-Term and EA Community Funds, and the CEA&apos;s stated goals, create a false impression in and around the movement the CEA can be trusted to effectively identify promising projects from within the community within these focus areas. Thus, to rectify this problem, I make the following suggestions:</span></span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span>Nick Beckstead or a member of the CEA&apos;s executive team make clear a new plan and intentions for how the Long-Term and EA Community Funds will be more effectively managed in the future, posted to the Effective Altruism Forum.<br></span></li>\n<li><span>The CEA consider hiring additional managers for each of these funds, given it&apos;s clear Nick alone doesn&apos;t have the bandwidth to manage both of them, or even one of them alone.<br></span></li>\n<li><span>Past and current donors to these funds inform the CEA how they would prefer the funds be allocated, and what kind of projects they&apos;d like to see funded, so the CEA, Nick and fund managers know what kind of new movement-building and long-term future projects in the community to search for.<br></span></li>\n<li><span>Until one or more of the above suggestions comes about, effective altruists refrain from donating more to the Long-Term and EA Community Funds.</span></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div></body></html>", "user": {"username": "Evan_Gaensbauer"}}]
