CEA could reduce the amount of unrestricted funding it gives GWWC, thereby in effect diverting the donations away from GWWC. This seems like it would be pretty easy to do - CEA could simply alter the allocation of shared costs, if nothing else, or borrow GWWC staff.

I\u2019ll give a very brief summary, mostly for others who were also wondering, since I sent you our reviews and plans which have more detail in. </p>\n<p>For most of 2014 we had one full-time person on Communications (Steph Crampin, who was staff) and one on Community (Ben Clifford (intern), followed by Lloyd Chapman (intern) and then Jon (staff)). Steph\u2019s main focus for the first half of the year was a major overhaul of the website, aiming to update its look and feel, make it easier to navigate and use, cut down a bunch of our admin by automating a lot of the pledging process, and make individual dashboards for people to make it easier for members to let us know about their donations. In the second half of the year she was more focused on the September internship and running events. The idea behind the events strategy was to work out the best ways to run events, aiming to then scale those through our chapters. Ben and Jon worked on inducting new members and administration linked to that (more so early on in the year, before the website changes), ran our chapters and did individual outreach and follow-up \u2013 encouraging people who had had some contact with effective altruism to join GWWC. We planned to hire a staff member to be our community director over the year (hence Jon), because the turn-over of interns meant loss of information, and in particular of relationships with members and chapters (although each individually did a very good job!). Over this period, we didn\u2019t have a full-time researcher \u2013 Rob, Andreas and Owen all pitched in to varying degrees. To a large extent we were drawing from the research we had previously done. The reason we didn\u2019t hire a researcher was simply that we didn\u2019t find someone we were happy with for the role. </p>\n<p>At the beginning of 2015, we had a bit of a change in strategy. Rather than focusing on running events ourselves, we shifted to focusing on chapters. Chapters have seemed to be most effective when carrying out their own initiatives, so we decided it would work best to play a mentoring role for chapter presidents, rather than taking a top down approach. Since chapters play a larger role in our new strategy, and since it involves conversation with each individual chapter, it made sense to have one person focusing solely on chapters, so Jon moved to doing that. We had also found that following up with people individually \u2013 offering to answer questions and address concerns about donating to effective charities, prompting them to start etc seemed pretty effective. So we planned for our communications person to do more of that (that will be a large part of what Luke focuses on). We finally found a great candidate for research \u2013 Hauke. Over 2014, our membership doubled. Yet if anything, we want to have more rather than less contact with our members than we have in the past \u2013 we want to get a good sense of the path people take to actually deciding to give away 10% of their income to the most effective charities, and support our members to reach out to others. Therefore, we decided to hire someone dedicated to our members \u2013 Alison. In terms of if we don\u2019t find the funds we want - we will not be able to hire Sam Deere long-term. His role going forward is still flexible, but it would include maintaining the GWWC website, since he is great at webdevelopment, and PR (which he has experience in from working in politics). It will likely include public speaking, and connecting with people in CSR departments. I think it would be a very bad outcome if we aren\u2019t able to employ Sam long-term. He has a wide variety of extremely useful experience (webdevelopment, PR, social media, graphic design, writing and public speaking), and fits very well into the team. He very much increases our capacity to experiment in terms of time, skills and ideas.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": "7Qf3nxBq4DGrhmP3d", "user": {"username": "Michelle_Hutchinson"}}, {"_id": "tsSkNHJw5SLNvZniv", "postedAt": "2015-05-05T02:24:36.213Z", "postId": "NJ5XvxeF5e8tAuzFi", "htmlBody": "<p>I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a clear cut-off between conceptual and empirical disagreements, and I think it\u2019s really important for us to highlight agreement rather than disagreement.

We also use median wage as a stand-in if we're missing future salary data, which (given our members are in general likely to earn more than median wage) we also think is conservative. Accordingly, it's likely that the amount donated will be higher in reality.</p>\n<p>We address this in more detail in our <a href=\"https://givingwhatwecan.org/fundraising-prospectus-2015\">fundraising prospectus</a> \u2013 see Appendix 2 for the full working.</p>\n<p>From page 23 of the prospectus:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This methodology obviously relies on the accuracy of members\u2019 predictions about their future income. In general we have found that these predictions seem conservative, as most people underestimate their future earning potential (1). If members do not estimate their future salary, we use the median salary for their country. We think that is a fairly pessimistic assumption, as our median member has an expected earning potential higher than the median wage (2).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And the footnotes to the above:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>(1) For example, many members estimate their future income will be\nthe same as their current income, even though they are at the beginning of their careers - in reality, income typically increases throughout a person\u2019s career\n(2) For example, many members attend prestigious universities and/or are pursuing careers that have an average salary much higher than the median wage</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The final $146m figure is arrived at by multiplying members' estimates of future salary by the number of years they have left in their careers. It therefore doesn't take into account any of this growth that you'd expect in reality. As such, it wouldn't make sense to go back and try to model growth based on the $146 million figure (say, $1.7 million in year one, growing to around $5.6 million/year by year 40, rather than a flat $3.7m per year)*.</p>\n<p>Instead, you'd need to apply your model (say, fast wage growth in the first 10-20 years of a career, then slower growth until retirement) to the member estimates <em>first</em> to derive the final figure, and use the yearly amounts in your calculation. Given our assumption that member estimates of future salary err on the low side, this means that both the final pledged amount, and the per-year amounts are likely to be higher, and therefore our effectiveness would in fact be higher, notwithstanding that the discounting/attrition rate would affect the final number more aggressively.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>*<em> I've tried this calculation, assuming a 4% growth rate for years 1-20 and a 2% growth rate in years 21-40. With a year one pledge of $1.7 million, this grows to $5.6 million by year 40, for a total of ~$147 million donated. This drops the effectiveness estimate down to 44-1 - a significant drop, but still excellent return for a donation to Giving What We Can.

I think, however, that a big fraction of the historical impact is due to on-going activity, of the kind that could continue, rather than being all due to the 'set up' generating the stream. And that would mean the historical ratio is a reasonable guide to the future.</p>\n<p>This can be hard to see from the outside, but if you look at where new pledgers are coming from, it's often new press coverage or student group activity. Many also only take the pledge after being nudged by someone in person, even if they had heard about GWWC some time before, so there's an important role just talking to lots of people about the pledge. These kinds of activities can be scaled much further.</p>\n<p>Moreover, GWWC tries to monitor the number of new pledges generated by new activities and will quit on anything that's not generating enough. You can see some estimates by Rob of marginal returns above.</p>\n<p>Overall, you'd still have to be very pessimistic. Suppose GWWC's historical leverage ratio is 60. For the <em>future</em> leverage ratio to be less than one, you'd (roughly) need to think there was a 98% chance that marginal activities produced zero returns rather than historical rates of return.</p>\n<p>Finally, I think it's helpful to bear in mind how tiny GWWC is. Suppose taking the GWWC pledge is as ethically demanding as vegetarianism, then it could one day reach 1% of the developed world. Since GWWC only has 1000 members, it has only reached 0.01% of its addressable market. Given such limited penetration, I think it would be surprising if there were no further returns to be had. It's not as if students at Cambridge (where ~100 people have taken the pledge recently) are radically different from those at other prestigious universities, so we should expect similar efforts to work elsewhere, so GWWC could already be 10x bigger even if just expanded among prestigious universities. If anything you might expect marginal costs per pledge to be dropping at this stage in GWWC's growth as you benefit from economies of scale and critical mass effects (and there's some evidence this is happening). Finally, given the chance that 99.99% of the value still lies in the future, it seems well worth spending a sizeable amount of resources now figuring out whether further growth is possible and how best to do it. In some ways, GWWC's marginal leverage ratio is besides the point: it's like looking at Google in its early days and deciding whether to invest or not based on whether it's already profitable.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": "iqKctBf6XxPnSkXoa", "user": {"username": "Benjamin_Todd"}}]
