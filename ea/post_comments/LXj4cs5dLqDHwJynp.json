Broadly speaking, Asian countries are generally underrepresented in climate activism, even in developed countries.&nbsp;<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefzqhvxrnumq\"><sup><a href=\"#fnzqhvxrnumq\">[1]</a></sup></span>Consequently, the inaugural <a href=\"https://mothership.sg/2019/10/sg-climate-rally-reactions/\">SG Climate Rally</a> was relatively small at ~2,000 participants. I helped organise this rally.</p><p>There's a few things to note here:</p><ol><li><strong>Singapore is known for very strict laws restricting protests.</strong> Under the Public Order Act introduced in 2008, any person assembling in a public place expressing support for or against a cause must register with the police for a permit. Long story short, even a solo protest must be pre-approved by the police. And the police don\u2019t approve topics deemed controversial \u2026 yeah.</li><li><strong>Singaporeans have a very negative opinion of protesting.</strong> It\u2019s a chicken-and-egg thing, but essentially in Singapore protesting carries a social taboo. Protests generally considered&nbsp;<i>\u201cmoderate\u201d</i> in other countries would be considered&nbsp;<i>\u201cradical\u201d</i> in Singapore.</li><li><strong>Singaporean climate advocacy organisations were all \u201cmoderate\u201d.</strong> There was no&nbsp;<i>\u201cradical wing\u201d</i> of climate activism in Singapore. In the Singaporean context, standing in the street alone for 15 minutes to protest for climate action would be&nbsp;<i>\u201cradical\u201d</i>. Our Overton Window is very different.</li><li><strong>Singapore had very insufficient climate commitments.</strong> In early 2020, after the SG Climate Rally, Singapore announced climate goals that included net zero timelines beyond 2050 <i>\"some time in the later half of this century\"</i> (i.e. no actual timeline), and a carbon tax of $5.</li></ol><h3><u>Decision Matrix</u></h3><ol><li>If I continued with&nbsp;<i>\u201cModerate Groups\u201d</i>, it seemed high-probability that commitments would remain insufficient.</li><li>If I branched off into&nbsp;<i>\u201cRadical Tactics\u201d</i>, then policymakers have to deal with both&nbsp;<i>\u201cModerate Groups\u201d</i> and&nbsp;<i>\u201cRadical Tactics\u201d</i>. Following the same logic as outlined in this post, this suggested a probability of improved climate commitments.</li></ol><p>From an x-risk prevention POV, the idea was to increase the probability of climate action by creating the threat of radical protests to&nbsp;<i>supplement/increase support for&nbsp;</i> moderate advocacy.<br>Basically, I did not think&nbsp;<strong>Radical &gt; Moderate</strong>, but rather&nbsp;<strong>Radical+Moderate &gt; Moderate Only.</strong></p><h1>EV calculations of \"Radical\" Climate Protests</h1><p>I calculated the rough Expected Value (EV) of my climate protest as follows:</p><ul><li>Assuming 1% chance of counterfactually affecting climate discourse (favourable due to lack of protests in SG increasing marginal benefit of 1 individual protest)</li><li>Excess deaths from 4.0C vs 1.5C: 4 million/year</li><li>Singapore's contribution to excess death: 1/1000 =&nbsp;<strong>4,000/year</strong></li><li>EV: 40 excess deaths/year &nbsp;=&nbsp;<strong>~1,000/25 yrs</strong></li><li>Risk: Major tail risk of 1-2 year's jail, criminal record, 5% chance of exile</li></ul><p>So, with about 2-3 orders of magnitude margin of error, I figured it was high-EV. After a big controversy and a year of organising, Singapore released climate goals that included a net zero goal by 2050, and a $80 carbon tax.</p><h1><u>Further thoughts</u></h1><p>I think a lot of people misinterpret advocacy, or at least climate advocacy.</p><ol><li><strong>In general, people don't like activism/protesting.</strong> More broadly, people are extra skeptical of ideas requiring high commitment that imply moral judgement. You can see this with EA, veganism, protesting, donating etc. People just don't respond well to the implicit premise that <i>\"Because I haven't been doing this, therefore I am immoral\"</i>, and instead it's more comfortable to go with <i>\"I really want to believe this person is wrong and misguided.\"</i>. This applies even between activities: for example, EAs feeling awkward discussing veganism/donations/protests with other EAs, regardless of the actual EV of the actions. There's a very valid discussion to be had with regards to the efficacy of advocacy/protest campaigns, but I'm usually wary of the extra skepticism I get just by virtue of being a climate activist and the negative connotations people have surrounding that.</li><li><strong>Critics often ignore \u201cmoderate\u201d groundwork, and then criticise a lack of moderate groundwork.</strong> A common criticism I hear to this day is&nbsp;<i>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you do [X] instead of [Y]\u201d</i>. X is usually implied as something vaguely less radical. However, in my experience, people who do&nbsp;<i>\u201cradical\u201d</i> advocacy often have years of experience in&nbsp;<i>\u201cmoderate\u201d</i> advocacy, even simultaneously doing both. I\u2019d say 99% of my work involved normal stuff like outreach to policymakers, organising petitions and lobbying. I think people just assume&nbsp;<i>\u201cradicals\u201d</i> dismiss&nbsp;<i>\u201cmoderates\u201d</i>, when in fact radicals often respect and work closely alongside the moderates who have always comprised 99% of the climate movement, but aren\u2019t reported on.</li><li><strong>People just assume activists are attention-seeking.</strong> This one, I don\u2019t fully get. Nowadays, there\u2019s countless ways to optimise for attention that have no downside risk. In fact, I messaged the most attention-seeking people I knew and asked them to join, but none of them did. Instead, it was usually people who were extremely anxious about climate risk+had a very high justice sensitivity. Interestingly, all of them were either LGBTQ+ or were neurodivergent.</li></ol><p>Anyway, just sharing my (hopefully relevant) experience. I did do a lot of social movement research literature review while organising climate protests, so even this is a very small fraction of my thoughts on the topic. People seem to assume that activists are impulsive and have poorly-crafted theories of change, so it's hard to elaborate on reasoning when a critic just asserts that you're dumb.<br><br>Happy to engage with other discussions on this topic! Nowadays I work at Nonlinear mainly on AI Safety/meta stuff, so climate activism doesn't come up super often other than cross-applying x-risk theories of change.</p><ol class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\"><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnzqhvxrnumq\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefzqhvxrnumq\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>The reason why is worthy of its own research/thread.</p></div></li></ol>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "Minh Nguyen"}}, {"_id": "KYoKXRWcNTL6D2JZr", "postedAt": "2022-12-17T08:28:46.930Z", "postId": "LXj4cs5dLqDHwJynp", "htmlBody": "<p>Nice! Very cool research idea and very interesting findings.

(Other relevant points <a href=\"https://www.sentienceinstitute.org/foundational-questions-summaries#confrontation-vs.-nonconfrontation\">here</a>.) I'd expect more radical tactics to be good at forcing an issue onto the public and policy agenda, but not good (possibly counterproductive) at persuading unsupportive members of the public to change their mind. Your evidence on polarisation supports this, I think. And if it such protests do indeed increase support for more moderate groups, as your study suggests, then that gives them more influence to negotiate with policy-makers.&nbsp;</p><p>My inferences are getting even more indirect now, but an implication of this is that radical campaigns targeted towards issues that the public are already supportive of would be helpful for forcing change, but not so helpful and perhaps counterproductive on issues where there isn't already popular support.

Did the survey include anything to test whether people &nbsp;who said that they had heard of Just Stop Oil really had? E.g. by testing whether they knew that JSO had performed radical tactics?

Are they positioning themselves this way <i>in how they want to come across</i>, or the <i>actual actions they take</i>? For some people (especially politicians/decision-makers) I could imagine that the performative nature of JSO-style protests might (sub-consciously?) underline to them that this is all about media theatre, and not about genuinely taking action or making change.

On your questions:</p><ul><li>On the 92% figure, we weren't explicit about this but yes, we also estimate that this is over-inflated vs reality for the reasons you said (people do weird things on surveys). In both this survey and a previous one for Animal Rebellion, we asked decoy questions about awareness of fictional organisations, and elicited awareness values of around 60% and 20% respectively, which is obviously very weird. We're not exactly sure how we're going to use this information to adjust our estimates, so feedback welcome. I wasn't too concerned about that particular result as I actually think that value is the least interesting of all of our findings, and don't think it's particularly informative for understanding the actual impact JSO had. I'll make an edit in the document though to be more explicit that this is likely overinflated so good point!&nbsp;</li><li>We hadn't done that particular analysis (for people who went from 0 awareness to &gt;0 awareness) but we can definitely do so!

So <strong>the survey might be finding \"willingness to appear aware of environmental topics leads to support for Friends of the Earth\" and not \"being aware of JSO leads to support for Friends of the Earth\". </strong>In terms of how to account for this, I would have suggested another question in the survey which asks people who said that they have heard of JSO to indicate what JSO is most associated with, and one of the answers is that they are associated with radical tactics, and others are plausible-sounding but false. I appreciate this might be difficult now -- the survey is already done. And you might want to draw a line under this and move on.

Another example: if the intended theory of change is protest --&gt; change in public attitudes --&gt; politicians believing that the public wants change, so the politicians make a change happen; in this case, it actually doesn't matter whether the public gains enough conviction to change their behaviour -- just enough conviction that they answer more positively in a survey is actually sufficient.</li></ul>", "parentCommentId": "rYjNWCzCgqKyAsBdn", "user": {"username": "Sanjay"}}, {"_id": "pfBLQyH8yvggekfng", "postedAt": "2022-12-20T12:05:54.074Z", "postId": "LXj4cs5dLqDHwJynp", "htmlBody": "<p>Ah I've understood you now!

I think for issues with low public support, it's not often that there is a big base of people who oppose an issue and we slowly win people other; Instead, I think it's more like that most of the population don't really have a view, and using radical tactics, you're getting them to actually form a view on an issue. I think the best example for me of this is the chart below, which shows public support for BLM (the group, not the issue) post-George Floyd protests. I think Animal Rebellion does similar stuff - It will turn a bunch of people off, it will probably attract some people, but ultimately it's getting a lot more people to actually take a stance.
