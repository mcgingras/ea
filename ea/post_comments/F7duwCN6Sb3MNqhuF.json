I expect it'll be helpful\u2013 I also agree with your recommendations for people to consider working at standard-setting organizations and other relevant EU offices.</p><p>One perspective that I see missing from this post is what I'll call the <strong>advocacy/comms/politics </strong>perspective. Some examples of this with the EU AI Act:</p><ul><li>Foundation models were going to be included in the EU AI Act, until France and Germany (with lobbying pressure from Mistral and Aleph Alpha) changed their position.</li><li>This initiated a political/comms battle between those who wanted to exclude foundation models (led by France and Germany) and those who wanted to keep it in (led by Spain).</li><li>This political fight rallied lots of notable figures, including folks like Gary Marcus and Max Tegmark, to publicly and privately fight to keep foundation models in the act.</li><li>There were <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Simeon_Cps/status/1727351406791630974\">open letters</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ai_ctrl/status/1728021633703493876\">op-eds</a>, and certainly many private attempts at advocacy.</li><li>There were attempts to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ai_ctrl/status/1726991082758533359\">influence public opinion</a>, pieces that <a href=\"https://garymarcus.substack.com/p/metas-chief-ai-officer-is-lying-about\">accused key lobbyists of lying</a>, and a lot of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tegmark/status/1728851164291059948\">discourse on Twitter</a>.</li></ul><p>It's difficult to know the impact of any given public comms campaign, but it seems quite plausible to me that many readers would have more marginal impact by focusing on advocacy/comms than focusing on research/policy development.</p><p>More broadly, I worry that many segments of the AI governance/policy community might be neglecting to think seriously about what ambitious comms/advocacy could look like in the space.</p><p>I'll note that I might be particularly primed to bring this up now that you work for Open Philanthropy. I think many folks (rightfully) critique Open Phil for being too wary of advocacy, campaigns, lobbying, and other policymaker-focused activities. I'm guessing that Open Phil has played an important role in shaping both the financial and cultural incentives that (in my view) leads to an overinvestment into research and an underinvestment into policy/advocacy/comms.&nbsp;</p><p>(I'll acknowledge these critiques are pretty high-level and I don't claim that this comment provides compelling evidence for them. Also, you only recently joined Open Phil, so I'm of course not trying to suggest that you created this culture, though I guess now that you work there you might have some opportunities to change it).</p><p>I'll now briefly try to do a Very Hard thing which is like \"put myself in Trevor's shoes and ask what I actually want him to do.\" One concrete recommendation I have is something like \"try to spend at least 5 minutes thinking about ways in which you or others around you might be embedded in a culture that has blind spots to some of the comms/advocacy stuff.\" Another is \"make a list of people you read actively or talked to when writing this post. Then ask if there were any other people/orgs you could've reached out, particularly those that might focus more on comms+adovacy\". (Also, to be clear, you might do both of these things and conclude \"yea, actually I think my approach was very solid and I just had Good Reasons for writing the post the way I did.\")</p><p>I'll stop here since this comment is getting long, but I'd be happy to chat further about this stuff. Thanks again for writing the post and kudos to OP for any of the work they supported/will support that ends up increasing P(good EU AI Act goes through &amp; gets implemented).&nbsp;</p>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "Akash"}}, {"_id": "snHdQ6uvWbEyBtRzi", "postedAt": "2023-12-20T23:16:08.170Z", "postId": "F7duwCN6Sb3MNqhuF", "htmlBody": "<p>(Cross-posting from LW)</p><p>Thanks for these thoughts! I agree that advocacy and communications is an important part of the story here, and I'm glad for you to have added some detail on that with your comment. I\u2019m also sympathetic to the claim that serious thought about \u201cambitious comms/advocacy\u201d is especially neglected within the community, though I think it\u2019s far from clear that the effort that went into the policy research that identified these solutions or work on the ground in Brussels should have been shifted at the margin to the kinds of public communications you mention.</p><p>I also think Open Phil\u2019s strategy is pretty bullish on supporting comms and advocacy work, but it has taken us a while to acquire the staff capacity to gain context on those opportunities and begin funding them, and perhaps there are specific opportunities that you're more excited about than we are.&nbsp;</p><p>For what it\u2019s worth, I didn\u2019t seek significant outside input while writing this post and think that's fine (given the alternative of writing it quickly, posting it here, disclaiming my non-expertise, and getting additional perspectives and context from commenters like yourself).
