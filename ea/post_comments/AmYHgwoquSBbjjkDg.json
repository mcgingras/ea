It can be tempting to try and persuade as many people about EA and run events that tweak the message of EA in an attempt to appeal to certain people. From our experience, this is generally a dangerous approach as it leads to low-fidelity diluted or garbled messages. Instead, think about outreach efforts as an \u2018offer\u2019 of EA where people can get a taste of what it\u2019s about and take it or leave it. It\u2019s OK if someone\u2019s not interested. A useful heuristic James used for testing whether to run an outreach event is to ask \u201cto what extent would the audience member now know whether effective altruism is an idea they would be interested in\u201d. It turned out that many speaker events that Oxford were running didn\u2019t fit this test, and neither did the fundraising campaign.</p></blockquote>", "parentCommentId": "TZbSGKnQc9e7tHMyC", "user": {"username": "DavidNash"}}]
