I have not mentioned what is meant by impact. Some thoughts:</p><ul><li>It depends on one's moral views, but I guess leaving it undefined was a fine way of accounting for <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/moral-uncertainty\">moral uncertainty</a>. People presumably gave their estimates based on their moral views.</li><li>In practice, each organisation has its own heuristics for impact. For Against Malaria Foundation, it may be the number of distributed bednets. For a research organisation, it may include the quantity and quality of publications. More generally, success in the objectives and key results of the organisation would be an indication of producing impact.</li></ul><blockquote><p>In the <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eB2jzpeqlcQ2p-vgmJe1CJNi4-R6ODUEmosZaHbp9bM/edit?usp%3Dsharing#\">email </a>you sent you asked for <i>\"(I_OM / C_OM) / (I_A / C_A)</i></p></blockquote><p>I would say I did not exactly ask people to use that formula. I asked:</p><blockquote><p>For both [organisation] and the effective altruism community, I would be happy to know your best guesses for the ratio between the expected marginal cost-effectiveness of:</p><ul><li>Operations management positions.</li><li>All positions.</li></ul></blockquote><p>Then, I gave that formula as as example:</p><blockquote><p>One example way of estimating the ratio is from (I_OM / C_OM) / (I_A / C_A)</p></blockquote><p>Only 3 people explicitly used this formula (in agreement with the tables of <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/LWN6qFhCtPDEJJpeG/cost-effectiveness-of-operations-management-in-high-impact#Multiplier_of_operations_management_in_high_impact_organisations\">this</a> section).</p><blockquote><p>It would've helped a lot to see this information in the post itself to follow <a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/reasoning-transparency/\">reasoning transparency</a>.</p></blockquote><p>Thanks for the feedback.
