Off the top of my head I struggle to imagine what data might help you drill down more on the cause and effect here, outside of asking women deeper questions. I wonder why PMI didn't just ask the women as well what contributed to them starting to use family planning for the first time, obviously that data would be flawed but if a decent number said \"I considered it after hearing on the radio\" that would help your case.</p>\n<p>If even half of these 250,000 new users (as a small comment it was strange that PMI had no error bars on their graphs) are due to FEM then this must be one of the most staggering results in the history of family planning interventions.
