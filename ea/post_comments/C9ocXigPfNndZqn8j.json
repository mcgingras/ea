We\u2019re planning to hire Luke Ilott in June, the largest part of whose job will be reaching out to people who have had some contact with the idea of giving effectively, and chatting/answering questions/addressing concerns/seeing how the person could get more involved. Our current outreach is also focused heavily on local groups (led by Jon Courtney). These seem both good ways of introducing people to the ideas, and also good ways to get people more engaged with them. Since GWWC is first and foremost a community, we\u2019re hopefully in somewhat of a good position to support people in the process of going from liking the sound of effective altruism, to really putting effective altruism into practice.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "Michelle_Hutchinson"}}, {"_id": "fJExxeLHEcwu4ZLZ9", "postedAt": "2015-03-25T23:17:15.651Z", "postId": "C9ocXigPfNndZqn8j", "htmlBody": "<p>I really like this and the funnel stuff cribbed from for profit orgs.

We've got good groups working together around EA for profit ventures, mainly in tech. We've got emerging groups around earning to give, even for poker players specifically. I'd like to see the EA movement get so big that we have groups that are focused on particular things. These might be organised by method (e.g. cognitive sciences, maths, management) and organised by subject (e.g. politics or healthcare). Having an organised matrix where people can be organised by which fields they have skills/networks in would also be interesting.

As Michelle mentioned I am spending most of my time focusing on chapter growth, and helping to support established and emerging chapters.  I completely agree with everything you said about the importance of local groups- in particular I think you are right that we need to be spending more time on supporting new EA meet-ups once they have started up.  More generally i think local meet-ups and chapters have a really important role to play in the 'EA funnel'.  They serve as a natural 'next-step' after people have heard about EA and are intrigued by the concept, &quot;interested in EA? Why not meet up with other people in your area talking about it?&quot;.  Chapters and meet-ups also serve as natural launching-off points for other projects like pamphleting or fundraising campaigns.  Also, in Giving What We Can's experience, chapter involvement has played a large part in many people deciding to sign the pledge.  This gives us some reason to think that chapters can play an important role in moving people from being interested in the ideas of EA to acting on them in their life.  For all of these reasons I think that we should be working hard to both create as many chapters and meet-up groups as we can, and provide a system to support and sustain chapters these chapters once they have started out.  Hopefully in the next week or so I will be posting here with concrete a proposal for a volunteer run 'Chapter Growth Team' which can help in this venture!</p>\n", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "jonathancourtney"}}, {"_id": "yuyKDbLsmC9s4bi2N", "postedAt": "2015-03-26T16:35:44.585Z", "postId": "C9ocXigPfNndZqn8j", "htmlBody": "<blockquote>\n<p>And there are four different books on effective altruism coming out, at least two of which will be marketed heavily by professionals.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I guess the two that will be marketed heavily by professionals are <a href=\"https://www.netgalley.com/catalog/show/id/60898\">Peter Singer's <em>The Most Good You Can Do</em></a> and <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Doing-Good-Better-Effective-Difference/dp/1592409105\">Will MacAskill's <em>Doing Good Better</em></a>, but could you please tell us which the other two books are?</p>\n", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "Stefan_Schubert"}}, {"_id": "xekZ8ovfSnxCBvxu4", "postedAt": "2015-03-26T18:11:29.326Z", "postId": "C9ocXigPfNndZqn8j", "htmlBody": "<p>There's also &quot;How to be Great at Doing Good: Why Results are What Count and How Smart Charity Can Change the World&quot; by Nick Cooney and &quot;Strangers Drowning: Grappling with Impossible Idealism, Drastic Choices, and the Overpowering Urge to Help&quot; by Larissa MacFarquhar.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": "yuyKDbLsmC9s4bi2N", "user": {"username": "Peter_Hurford"}}, {"_id": "y8vTC6JggsWGM3Heb", "postedAt": "2015-03-26T22:39:41.380Z", "postId": "C9ocXigPfNndZqn8j", "htmlBody": "<p>Thanks!</p>\n", "parentCommentId": "xekZ8ovfSnxCBvxu4", "user": {"username": "Stefan_Schubert"}}, {"_id": "GbTkw96Z69rCL7HkG", "postedAt": "2015-03-27T14:07:44.356Z", "postId": "C9ocXigPfNndZqn8j", "htmlBody": "<blockquote>\n<p>Is anyone working on adapting this guide to EA startups to supply meetups with a default agenda?
