I'll share a few scattered, preliminary thoughts to spark discussion, and I hope to see more work on this topic in the future.</p><ul><li>These 2022 results seem to be in line with the very similar surveys conducted by Rethink Priorities in 2019, which I found very useful, but I don't know if those results have been shared publicly. Will you be sharing that data too? I know it's been eagerly anticipated, and Sentience Institute has held off on similar work while waiting for it. I'm not sure if that 2019 data is now seen as just a pilot for this 2022 data collection?</li><li>In addition to 2017 and 2020, Sentience Institute asked these questions in <a href=\"https://www.sentienceinstitute.org/aft-survey\">the 2019 and 2021 Animals, Food, and Technology (AFT) surveys with similar results</a>.</li><li>In 2017, we <a href=\"https://www.sentienceinstitute.org/animal-farming-attitudes-survey-2017#table-\">preregistered credible intervals </a>and informally solicited estimates from many others. <strong>The data was surprisingly ban-supporting relative to priors, which may be a more important takeaway than any post-hoc explanation.</strong> I didn't preregister any CIs for the 2019 or 2022 RP results. I think these drops in ban support are around what I'd expect, but it's very hard to say in hindsight, especially with other variation (e.g., different outcome scales, presumably different samples).</li><li>The Sentience Institute AFT survey also has questions with pro/con information, e.g., \"Some people think that we should ban all animal farming and transition to plant-based and cultured foods, to reduce harm to humans and animals. Others think that we should keep using animals for food, to provide the conventional meat consumers are used to eating. Where would you place yourself on this scale?\" (wording based on <a href=\"https://gssdataexplorer.norc.org/variables/759/vshow\">the GSS</a>). <strong>That wording seems to </strong><a href=\"https://www.sentienceinstitute.org/aft-survey-2021#means-and-distributions\"><strong>elicit much stronger ban support</strong></a><strong> than this new wording (though take with a large grain of salt due to other variation in the surveys), which seems to make sense as it is much more ban-supporting than the ban-opposing \"it is wrong to kill animals\" and \"right to eat meat if they choose\" wordings.</strong> Concretely, on a 1\u20136 support scale, we found a mean of 4.12 (95% CI: 4.04\u20134.21) &nbsp;for \"ban all animal farming\" with our nationally representative sample in 2021. I think it's fair to say that's much higher despite also having pro/con information, and <strong>I think it's important qualification for interpreting the 2022 RP results that people may miss out on in this post.</strong></li><li>Social scientists have long asked \"Is there really any such thing as public opinion?\" <a>(Lewis 1939)</a>, and I think the majority answer has been some version of &nbsp;\"public opinion does not exist\" (e.g., <a href=\"https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Public-Opinion-and-Public-Opinion-Polling-Blumer/1bdf4991e814553094b045be1bd481d8706883c8\">Blumer 1948</a>, <a href=\"https://is.muni.cz/el/fss/podzim2019/POLn4102/um/blok1/Bourdieu_PO_Does_Not_Exist.pdf\">Bourdieu 1972</a>): There are many interesting wordings to consider: simple vs complex, ban-supporting vs ban-opposing, socially desirable and acquiescing vs socially undesirable and anti-acquiescing, politically left vs right favored, financially incentivized, politically engaged, etc. <strong>All question wordings matter, and none are objectively correct or objectively biased. I think we may disagree on this point because you say some question wordings &nbsp;\"are biased towards answering \u201cYes\u201d...\", though you may mean some subjective standard of bias, such as distance from likely counterfactual ballot measure results.</strong> Some wordings more naturally jibe with what people have in mind when they see survey results\u2014I prioritize simple wordings in part for this reason\u2014but ideally we share the exact survey wording alongside percentages or scores whenever possible to ensure that clarity.</li><li>If you have time, what was the sample (M Turk, Prolific, Civis Analytics, Ipsos Omnibus, Knowledge Panel, etc.), what were the demographics, and was it weighted for representativeness, and if so, how?</li><li>What exactly do you mean by \"strong\" in \"strong basis for more radical action\"? One operationalization I like is: <strong>All things considered, I think these survey and ballot results should update the marginal farmed animal advocate towards more radical approaches relative to their prior.</strong> I'd love to know if you agree.</li></ul><p>Well-done again on this very interesting work! <i>[minor edits made to this comment for clarity and fixing typos]</i></p>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "Jacy"}}, {"_id": "FHbwuWfMMZ4rCKDmD", "postedAt": "2022-11-10T01:45:19.295Z", "postId": "Gr3t8vWcWpwBoNNTk", "htmlBody": "<p>Thanks for doing this important work!

In practice, I imagine many advocates have been relying on surveys showing much higher support as their benchmark so this survey would update them toward more pessimism.&nbsp;</li><li>More generally, given the clear variation in support results from well-done surveys from different organizations on this specific item it doesn't seem advisable for advocates to update their beliefs strongly on how support for other specific or the whole class of radical policies will be. As we wrote, it would be better to test the specific policies in question with a variety of messages to get closer to understanding how the public might actually act if given the chance to vote. And of course compare these to more moderate asks that the movement thinks are also worthwhile in expectation. I don't think we should take attitudes towards a specific policy as very indicative of attitudes to all of animal agriculture or other anti-factory farming policies. I also don't think we should take attitudes towards all of animal agriculture as indicative of support for specific policy proposals advocated for under specific messages. It was the claim that support for banning slaughterhouses should encourage advocates to push stronger messages and policies that we wanted to raise more questions about.&nbsp;</li><li>Thanks for the reminder about the 2021 AFT survey!- which if I'm correct also showed ~43% support for banning slaughterhouses, when including No Opinion.

Their theory is that by asking respondents first whether they agreed with statements about meat reduction, discomfort with the way animals are used in the food industry, and animal sentience it cued their ideal self so that \u201cthe desire to not appear hypocritical induced them to activate a mixture of their ideal and common self\u201d when answering questions about bans on animal farming, factory farming, and slaughterhouses.</p><p><br>The actual design of their study is a little too complicated to explain here (involving four treatments that altered the order and wording of ideal and common self questions, some food-related and some non-food related, as well as inserting buffer questions), but basically some respondents saw the ban questions before the ideal self questions, and others saw them in the same order as in the original 2017 SI study.
