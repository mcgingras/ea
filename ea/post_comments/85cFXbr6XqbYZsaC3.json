That amounts to adding log(X), and an expectation of a sum is just the sum of the expectation.

By assumption Y is an independent variable (note: this assumption seems questionable, and without it the two conclusions definitely come apart, as the investor may have opportunities which increase the wealth of the rest of the world but not the wealth of the investor).</p>\n<p>So X = Y + d.</p>\n<p>So E(d/X)</p>\n<p>= E(d/(Y+d)) </p>\n<p>~ E(log(1 + d/(Y+d))) </p>\n<p>= E(log((Y + d + d)/Y)) </p>\n<p>= E(log(1+2d)/Y))</p>\n<p>~ E(2d/Y)</p>\n<p>= 2 E(d/Y)</p>\n<p>= 2 E(log(1+d/Y))</p>\n<p>= 2 E(log(Y + d) - log(Y))</p>\n<p>= 2 E(log(X) - log(Y))</p>\n<p>= 2 E(log(X)) - 2 E(log(Y))</p>\n<p>Now since Y is independent, E(log(Y)) is constant, so maximising this is equivalent to maximising E(log(X)).</p>\n<p>Edit: how did you do the code?
