But nothing formal was ever published. The &#x201C;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4YrmltF2I0\">Celebrating Failed Projects</a>&#x201D; panel eventually shared a few lessons, but someone would need to watch an almost hour-long video (much of which does not relate to EAV) to see them all. And the lessons seem trivial (&#x201C;if you&#x2019;re doing a project which gives money to people, you need to have that money in your bank account first&#x201D;) about as often as they seem insightful (&#x201C;Finding excellent entrepreneurs is much, much harder than I thought it was going to be&#x201D;). </p><p>If a proper post-mortem with community input had been conducted, I&#x2019;m confident many other lessons would emerge*, including one prominent one: &#x201C;Don&#x2019;t over-promise and under-deliver.&#x201D; This has obvious relevance to a grantmaking project that launched before it had lined up funds to grant (as far as I know EAV only made two grants- the <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/TFDTKfemMnGbKp3YG/announcing-effective-altruism-ventures?commentId=KM6jp6kWKuMrtRTBS\">one Jamie mentioned</a> and a <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/eQpAPSbfejeud8fkj/ea-ventures-request-for-projects-update\">$19k grant to EA Policy Analytics</a>). But it also relates to more mundane aspects of EAV: my understanding is that applicants were routinely given overly optimistic expectations about how quickly the process would move.</p><p>The missed opportunity to learn these lessons went on to impact other projects. As just one example, EA Grants was <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4YrmltF2I0\">described</a> as &#x201C;the spiritual successor to EA Ventures&#x201D;. And it did reflect the narrow lesson from that project, as it lined up money before soliciting grant applications. However, the big lesson wasn&#x2019;t learned and EA Grants consistently overpromised and under-delivered throughout its entire history. EA Grants <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/BwzKCiw3rn6tx3Lrw/update-on-cea-s-ea-grants-program?commentId=LjANvwJSrgfZ8YrCw\">announced plans to distribute millions of dollars more money than it actually granted, repeatedly announced unrealistic and unmet plans to accept open applications</a>, <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/org8QYG3gqgDK7St6/effective-altruism-grants-project-update#We_can_t_fund_educational_expenses_\">explicitly described educational grants as eligible when they were not</a>, <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/3fdmHnLiQ3bm3J6Mc/which-community-building-projects-get-funded#Grant_outcomes1\">granted money to a very narrow set of projects</a>, and (despite its public portrayal as a project capable of distributing millions of dollars annually) <a href=\"https://www.centreforeffectivealtruism.org/our-mistakes/#ea-grants-2017-2019\">did not maintain</a> an &#x201C;appropriate operational infrastructure and processes [resulting] in some grant payments taking longer than expected [which in some cases] contributed to difficult financial or career situations for recipients.&#x201D; </p><p>EAV and EA Grants have both been shuttered, and there&#x2019;s a new management team in place at CEA. So if I had a sense that the new management had internalized the lessons from these projects, I wouldn&#x2019;t bring any of this up. But CEA&#x2019;s recently updated &#x201C;<a href=\"https://www.centreforeffectivealtruism.org/our-mistakes/\">Mistakes</a>&#x201D; page doesn&#x2019;t mention over-promising/under-delivering, which makes me worry that&#x2019;s not the case. That&#x2019;s especially troubling because the community has repeatedly highlighted this issue: when CEA <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/wL6nzXsHQEAZ2WJcR/summary-of-core-feedback-collected-by-cea-in-spring-summer#Things_Which_Could_Be_Improved\">synthesized community feedback</a> it had received, the top problem reported was &#x201C;respondents mentioned several times that CEA &#x2018;overpromised and under delivered&#x2019;&#x201D;. The <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/wL6nzXsHQEAZ2WJcR/summary-of-core-feedback-collected-by-cea-in-spring-summer?commentId=hBLLQE9RRHBQnrPLd\">most upvoted comment</a> on that post? It was Peter Hurford describing that specific dynamic as &#x201C;my key frustration with CEA over the past many years.&#x201D;</p><p>To be fair, the &#x201C;Mistakes&#x201D; page discusses problems that are <em>related</em> to over-promising/under-delivering, such as acknowledging that &#x201C;running too many projects from 2016-present&#x201D; has been an &#x201C;underlying problem.&#x201D; But it&#x2019;s possible to run too many projects without overpromising, and it&#x2019;s possible to be narrowly focused on one or a few projects while still overpromising and under-delivering. &#x201C;Running too many projects&#x201D; explains why EA Grants had little or no dedicated staff in early 2018; it doesn&#x2019;t explain why CEA <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/BwzKCiw3rn6tx3Lrw/update-on-cea-s-ea-grants-program?commentId=LjANvwJSrgfZ8YrCw\">repeatedly committed</a> to scaling the project during that period despite not having the staff in place to execute. I agree CEA has had a problem of running too many projects, but I see the consistent over-promising/under-delivering dynamic as far more problematic. I hope that CEA will increasingly recognize and incorporate this recurring feedback from the EA community. And I hope that going forward, CEA will prioritize thorough post-mortems (that include stakeholder input) on completed projects, so that the entire community can learn as much as possible from them. </p><p>* Simple example: with the benefit of hindsight, it seems likely that EAV significantly overinvested in developing a complex evaluation model before the project launched, and that EAV&#x2019;s staff may have had an inflated sense of their own expertise. From the <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/TFDTKfemMnGbKp3YG/announcing-effective-altruism-ventures?commentId=uQCjbfK32pDyDcNXL\">EAV website at its launch</a>:</p><blockquote>&#x201C;We merge expert judgment with statistical models of project success. We used our expertise and the expertise of our advisers to determine a set of variables that is likely to be positively correlated with project success. We then utilize a multi-criteria decision analysis framework which provides context-sensitive weightings to several predictive variables. Our framework adjusts the weighting of variables to fit the context of the projects and adjusts the importance of feedback from different evaluators to fit their expertise.&#x201D;</blockquote>", "parentCommentId": "KM6jp6kWKuMrtRTBS", "user": {"username": "AnonymousEAForumAccount"}}]
