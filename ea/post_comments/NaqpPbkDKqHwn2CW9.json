Reform is needed to base protection on evidence of sentience and suffering capacity.</li><li>A revised ethical framework is required to guide researchers on welfare trade-offs when replacing \"higher\" with \"lower\" animals, considering factors beyond legal status.</li></ol><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i>This comment was auto-generated by the EA Forum Team.
