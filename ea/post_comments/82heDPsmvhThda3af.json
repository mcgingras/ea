We take it this would generate the maximum effect, as participants would know (rather than have to guess) what the experimenter would like to hear. Haushofer et al., (<a href=\"https://www.nber.org/papers/w28106\">2020</a>), found no impact of explicitly stating that they expected the intervention to increase (or decrease) self-reports of depression. The results were non-significant and close to zero (n = 1,545). We take this research to suggest social desirability bias is not a major issue with psychotherapy. Moreover, it\u2019s unclear why, if there were a social desirability bias, it would be proportionally <i>more </i>acute for psychotherapy than other interventions. Further tests of experimenter demand effects would be welcome.&nbsp;</p><p>Other less relevant evidence of experimenter demand effects finds that it results in effects that are small or close to zero.

StrongMinds consciously included these Minimal/Mild cases in Phase Two because these patients indicated suicidal thoughts in their PHQ-9 evaluation.

Thanks for the questions. I wouldn't quite say we solved it, but we have found a solution that has had tremendous results in Uganda and Zambia. There are probably a few reasons for this. &nbsp;Most of the communities we work in are very close-knit and interpersonal, so the group talk therapy model of IPT-G works well. Additionally, around 85% of women in sub-Saharan Africa don't have access to quality mental health care. There is a huge treatment gap, for instance, Uganda has approximately 30 trained psychiatrists serving a population of 45M, so we are also filling a dire need by providing these free services using lay community health workers. The symptoms of depression are still not commonly known in Uganda and Zambia, and many people think they are just fatigued, sick, or just unmotivated/lazy, so discovering that there is a way to treat their symptoms and that there are other people experiencing this too is life-changing. Many women in therapy groups form a bond and continue to meet long after therapy ends. They now have a new support system and are no longer isolated. All of these factors play a role in our success.&nbsp;</p><p>The program model can be replicated in other geographical locations, and <a href=\"https://psychnews.psychiatryonline.org/doi/10.1176/appi.pn.2021.5.4\">IPT has been shown to work well cross-culturally.</a> We are currently exploring<a href=\"https://www.strongmindsamerica.org/\"> an American pilot </a>where the need is also extreme in underserved BIPOC communities.

In all honesty, our model is very low-tech. There are no apps or fancy gadgets. We also don't use prescription medicine (which may be why a pharma company has yet to snap us up!) Finally, the women we treat mostly live on less than $2 a day, so they aren't in an income bracket that many investors might want as consumers. While apps, tech, and pharmaceutical partnerships receive considerable funds, mental health in low and middle-income countries trying to help with poverty reduction is not heavily funded. Yearly global costs from mental, neurological, and substance use disorders are estimated at <a href=\"https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/universalhealthcoverage\">between $2.5 and $8.5 trillion dollars</a> a year.

This made it somewhat tricky to reach our target demographic since many women share a phone with their family or neighbors (and some don't own a phone at all.) Fortunately, the depression-free rates were comparable to in-person group therapy, and some ultimately preferred the flexibility it offered. We usually work in communities, offering therapy directly where the women live to make access easy (our motto was often to diagnose on a doorstep, treat under a tree.) We had to reach new clients using things like radio ads, social media, and a mental health WhatsApp-based chatbot to help ensure resources were available as often as needed.

Unfortunately, since then, we have seen other climate-related humanitarian crises causing things like flooding and drought, undoubtedly worsening mental health conditions. Additionally, Uganda currently has some Ebola lockdowns in place, stressing already thinned health resources. StrongMinds has made ourselves available to support in these cases. We know mental health care is critical during high-stress times, and rates are only projected to increase in the coming decades. The good news, though, is, as you've eloquently stated, the interpersonal nature of group talk therapy enhances outcomes. We've seen that 72% of former clients we spoke to in Uganda were still in touch with their group mates. This extends years later in many cases.&nbsp;</li><li>Absolutely! I've often said that the hardest part of our job is finding depressed individuals and getting them into a group. Depression can make simply getting out of bed a challenge, so this can be tricky. The group model works well to help with this scenario, though, because group members can hold each other accountable and check in on each other. Uganda and Zambia still have many stigmas associated with mental health, so advocacy and psychoeducation are critical to our work in-country. You can read more about the complete therapy assessment process and how we work to educate about mental health <a href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/global-events/202109/they-called-me-lazy-addressing-depression-stigma-in-uganda\">here in this Psychology Today article</a> by our talented Uganda Country Director/Clinician, Tina Ntulo.&nbsp;</li><li>Similarly, a small door-to-door study led by StrongMinds in Mukono District, Uganda, estimated that the prevalence of moderate to severe depression in adult women was about 20%. We also have about 85% of individuals with no access to other forms of treatment. IPT works particularly well in these settings and is currently<a href=\"https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-MSD-MER-16.4\"> a WHO-recommended first-line treatment </a>for depression in low-resource settings.

Thanks for the questions! Yes, there are advantages and disadvantages to both individual and group therapy, and as you mentioned, cost certainly favors the group model.

In terms of patient outcomes, StrongMinds doesn't utilize individual therapy, but <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30849287/\">some studies have shown that effectiveness overall is pretty similar</a>, and it really comes down to individual (and sometimes cultural) preferences to determine what type of therapy is best. I hope that helps!</p><p>In terms of SSRIs, yes, they can certainly be effective. In some cases where we think the client is a risk to themselves or others during therapy pre-screening, we refer them to where they have access to other methods, including SSRIs or other prescription options. That said, there are some significant challenges with the availability of SSRIs, given the treatment gap and the fact that everyone may not have the access needed to get to a trained psychiatrist/psychologist or nurse to prescribe them. This is one of the reasons the <a href=\"https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240049338\">WHO recently cited and recommended community-based models and methods </a>using lay community workers rather than trained mental health professionals as a key way to meet the growing need for services.&nbsp;</p><p>In terms of cost-effectiveness, prescribed medication is reasonably affordable, but the cost can add up over a lifetime of use.

It doesn't necessarily mean SM isn't a great charity. It doesn't mean it's not possible for StrongMinds to be the best charity in the future, or be the best under different philosophical assumptions.

Was it based on different methodology between the two pilots, or something else? As far as I can tell, the difference in methodology RE: recording PHQ-9 scores was that in phase 1 these were scored weekly from week 5-16, with a post-assessment scoring at week 17, and for phase 2, these were done biweekly from week 2-12, with a post-assessment at week 14. It's not clear that this difference leads to bias in one but not the other.<br><br><strong>b) </strong>Also curious about the separate analysis that came to 92%, which states: \"Since this impact figure was collected at a regular IPT group meeting, as had been done bi-weekly throughout the 12- week intervention, it is unlikely that any bias influenced the figure.\" I don't quite understand how collection at a regular IPT group meeting makes bias unlikely - could you clarify this? Presumably participants knew in advance how many weeks the intervention would be?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>2) </strong>I took the 10% from StrongMinds' <a href=\"https://strongminds.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/strongminds-phase-1-and-2-follow-up-evaluations_final.pdf\">2017 report (pg 2)</a>, not an HLI analysis (though if HLI independently came to that conclusion or have reviewed it and agreed I'd be interested too):&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>While both the Phase 1 and 2 patients had <strong>95% depression-free rates</strong> at the completion of formal sessions, our Impact Evaluation reports and subsequent experience has helped us to understand that those rates were somewhat inflated by social desirability bias, <strong>roughly by a factor of approximately ten percentage points</strong>. This was due to the fact that their Mental Health Facilitator administered the PHQ-9 at the conclusion of therapy. StrongMinds now uses external data collectors to conduct the post-treatment evaluations. Thus, for effective purposes, <strong>StrongMinds believes the actual depression-free rates for Phase 1 and 2 to be more in the range of 85%</strong>.</p><p>[emphasis added]</p></blockquote><p>I couldn't find a justification of this figure in that report or any of the preceding reports. (admittedly I just very quickly searched for various combinations of 10/85/95% and didn't read the entire report)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>3) </strong>Makes sense - looking forward to the results of the RCT! I assume it will be independent and pre-registered?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>4)</strong> Thanks! Just looked in a bit more detail - in <a href=\"https://strongminds.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/StrongMinds-Phase-Two-Impact-Evaluation-Report-July-2015-FINAL.pdf\">Appendix A (pg 30)</a> it says:</p><p>\"Use of lay community workers as the IPT-G facilitators, or Mental Health Facilitators(MHFs)</p><ul><li>MHFs require at least a high-school diploma, and are employed and salaried by StrongMinds. They receive two weeks of training by a certified IPT-G expert and receive on-going supervision and guidance by a mental health professional. Since they are community members themselves, they are well-received by the depressed patients. The IPT-G training curriculum includes modules on mental illness in general, depression, interpersonal psychotherapy, management of suicidality, and the goals and objectives for each weekly session of the 16 total sessions that are held. The training extensively uses role-playing to recreate group meeting settings.\"</li></ul><p>In <a href=\"https://strongminds.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/StrongMinds-Phase-Two-Impact-Evaluation-Report-July-2015-FINAL.pdf\">Appendix E (pg 33)</a> it says:</p><ul><li>\"StrongMinds completed training its initial cadre of four MHFs in March, 2014. The training lasted 10 days and was conducted by two Ugandans certified in IPT-G by Columbia University. In addition, the training was monitored long-distance via Skype by our senior technical advisor who is an international expert on IPT-G from Columbia University.\"</li><li>\"In Phase One of the 2014-2015 pilot in Uganda, our 4 MHFs were supervised by the two Ugandan IPT-G experts noted above. In Phase Two, StrongMinds hired a full-time Mental Health Supervisor (MHS) who both conducted IPT groups and supervised the 4 MHFs. This MHS was actually a member of the 2002 RCT in Uganda and has over ten years of IPT-G experience\"</li></ul><p><strong>a)</strong> Just confirming that \"lay counsellor\" is the same as \"IPT-G facilitator\" and \"mental health facilitator\"? If not, what are the differences? How much training do they get and what's their role in the intervention etc.</p><p><strong>b)</strong> How does StrongMinds select for empathy? E.g. questionnaire, interview, etc.<br><br><strong>c)</strong> What does it mean to be a \"certified IPT-G expert\"? For example, it sounds like there are a lot of various <a href=\"https://iptinstitute.com/ipt-certification/\">levels of certification</a>. From a quick google the best match I found for the description of the training was <a href=\"https://www.cugmhp.org/programs/gmh-summer-institute/#:~:text=Specifically%2C%20participants%20of%20this%206%2Dday%20training%20program%20learn%20to%20use%20Group%20Interpersonal%20Psychotherapy%20and%20the%20World%20Health%20Organization%E2%80%99s%20(WHO)%20Mental%20Health%20Gap%20Humanitarian%20Intervention%20Guide\">this</a>, which suggests a \"certified IPT-G expert\" is someone who has completed this specific 6-day course, i.e., with a level A certification? (Happy to be corrected - just couldn't find any details of this). If true, am I understanding correctly that the StrongMinds lay counsellors / mental health facilitators take a 10 day training course which is delivered by someone who has taken a 6-day course? Do the certified IPT-G experts play a role in SM other than the initial training of lay counsellors?</p><p><strong>d)</strong> What does it mean to be a \"mental health supervisor\"? What's their role in SM?</p><p><strong>e) </strong>[Minor] I just realised the appendix said MHFs require at least a high school diploma, contra what you said earlier: \"in fact, they don't even need to have a high school degree\". I assume this was just a more recent change in policy. Not a big deal, just clarifying.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>5) </strong>I had another question, which came up as I was going through the tax returns Joel linked to work out the cost per client reached - in the tax return it says</p><blockquote><p>STRONGMINDS IS A SOCIAL ENTERPRISE THAT PROVIDES LIFECHANGING DEPRESSION TREATMENT TO LOW-INCOME INDIVIDUALS IN SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA.</p></blockquote><p>This didn't exist in the tax returns before 2019, but came up every year from 2019 onwards.</p><p><strong>a)</strong> Was there a change in model in terms of revenue streams or business model for StrongMinds - if so, what changed?</p><p><strong>b) </strong>You'll probably cover this in some of the other questions, but how do the partnerships work? Do partners pay you <a href=\"https://strongminds.org/scaling-through-partnerships/#:~:text=The%20training%20and%20handover%20process%20takes%20place%20over%20the%20course%20of%20about%20one%20year%20of%20on%2Dsite%20technical%20assistance.\">for the year of training</a>? What does this training look like?</p><p><strong>c)</strong> Are there other revenue streams that StrongMinds have outside of donors / grants?
