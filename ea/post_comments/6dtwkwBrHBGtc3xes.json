They say they prefer to use cost-effectiveness estimates only as one input in their thinking about charities (with \u2018track record\u2019 and \u2018certainty of results\u2019 being two other important but hard-to-quantify inputs), and therefore (I infer) don\u2019t want to compare charities head-to-head because the 21.2x of AMF is not the same sort of \u2018thing\u2019 as the 9.8x of Malaria Consortium. For sure, Health Economists would agree that there may be factors beyond pure cost-effectiveness to consider when making a decision (e.g. equity considerations, commercial negotiation strategies that companies might employ and so on), but typically this consideration happens after the cost-effectiveness modelling, to avoid falling into the trap I mentioned above where you implicitly state that you are working with two different kinds of \u2018thing\u2019 even though they actually compete for the same resources [4].</p>\n<p>[...] I really do want to stress how jarring it is to see a cost-effectiveness model which doesn\u2019t actually deliver on the promise of guiding resource utilisation at the margin.

In order to make a choice, we need to make some assumptions -- either explicit or implicit -- about how to compare those different types of outputs.

I think I've managed to conflate two issues in your mind.</p><p>The first is exactly as you say; any intervention worth doing has some effects which are easy to model and some which are difficult (maybe impossible) to model. What GiveWell has done is completely reasonable here; modelling what it can and then making assumptions about how important the other things, like track record, are in comparison to the main cost-effectiveness results.</p><p>The second issue is the more subtle one that I was driving at. Imagine you are going to buy a new car, and your friend (who knows about cars) says that modern cars are 10x more fuel efficient than the car you currently drive. Speaking very roughly, there are two strategies you could pick from to choose your next car:</p><ul><li>&nbsp;Completely ignore your friend, and pick the car that has the best MPG regardless of any other feature. This would be a good strategy if <strong>literally all you care about </strong>is fuel efficiency, but a bad strategy otherwise (because it is unlikely the most fuel efficient car is also the most comfortable to drive - especially if fuel efficiency and comfort are sort-of tradeoffs)</li><li>Treat your friend as having offered a useful rule of thumb, and so have an idea in your head about what 'good' fuel efficiency looks like. &nbsp;This is a good strategy if cars aren't really directly comparable along a straightforward scale - a Ford F-150 isn't 'better' or 'worse' than a Prius, it is just a different kind of thing.</li></ul><p>Both GiveWell (implicitly) and me in my fertility days (explicitly) argue that QALYs are like cars - you can end up in a situation where you can generate different kinds of QALYs and your best bet is to compare them with a rule of thumb like GiveWell's 10x multiplier. However I don't think GiveWell is correct in making this assumption about charities - there is in fact a single measure like MPG which we want to ruthlessly optimise, and therefore we do actually want to it the F-150 and Prius directly against each other.</p><p>However my point in the essay is that GiveWell don't actually have to choose - they can build their model as if they are in the first world and directly compare charities together, and then make their final decision as though they are in the second world and different charities will offer different profiles of benefit on top of their cost-effectiveness. This is pretty much the commonsense way of choosing a car too - you would look at MPG and directly compare cars in this way, but you might then consider other factors. It would be weird to lump all cars together in your head as 'better than 10x my previous efficiency' or 'worse than 10x my previous efficiency'.</p>", "parentCommentId": "xc2NQBQ7LDxKhknrD", "user": {"username": "Froolow"}}, {"_id": "hak67KhacqAGAM4q9", "postedAt": "2022-08-29T09:20:10.415Z", "postId": "6dtwkwBrHBGtc3xes", "htmlBody": "<p>One of the key takeaways in the body of the text which perhaps I should have brought out more in the summary is that the GiveWell model is basically as reliable as highly professionalised bodies like pharma companies have figured out how to make a cost-effectiveness model. A small number of minor errors are unexceptional for a model of this complexity, even models that we submit to pharma regulators that have had several million dollars of development behind them.&nbsp;</p><p>I would say that while the errors are uninteresting and unexceptional, the unusual model design decisions are worth commenting on. The GiveWell team are admirably transparent with their model, and anybody who wants to review it can have access to almost everything at the click of a button (some assumptions are gated to GiveWell staff, but these aren't central). Given this, it is remarkable the EA community didn't manage to surface anyone who knew enough about models to flag to GiveWell that there were optimisations in design to be made - the essay above is not really arcane modelling lore but rather something anyone with a few years' experience in pharma HEOR could have told you. Is this because there are too few quant actors in the EA space? Is it because they don't think their contributions would be valued so don't speak up? Is it because criticism of GiveWell makes you unemployable in EA spaces so is heavily incentivised against?

I agree with everywhere you've said the issue is too small to be worth addressing, and also with the correction that because AMF and SMC used different data sources it was legitimate not to explicitly model indirect deaths for the AMF (I'm also pleased you've standardised your methodology in the updated model, because this was quite a big discrepancy between approaches).</p><p>I don't totally agree with the other areas where you've said you're confident there is no error at all. I think a better interpretation might be that you've got a reasonable simplifying assumption that isn't worth adjusting. For example, you say that it is appropriate to use different methodologies to account for the spillover effects of cash transfer vs income increase from deworming, which results in larger effective household sizes for cash transfer than for deworming. This is because deworming increases income via improving the earning potential of one member of the household, so there needs to be an adjustment for multi-earner households. Obviously you're the topic area experts so I'd defer to you on whether or not this is reasonable, but the way you've implemented this seems contestable to me in the abstract; around 40% of the benefits of GiveDirectly are assumed to be accrued in the form of dividends on a long-term capital investment, but those benefits are distributed across the entire family of 4.7 for the entire ten-year period of the intervention, whereas in the deworming models you explicitly downweight family size to account for dependents leaving the household over time and the possibility of having two earners in a household. It seems more defensible to me to use a constant family size over the two interventions, and instead adjust the number of consumption doublings the deworming intervention provides to account for some families having two wage earners (so a doubling in individual income from the intervention doesn't translate to a doubling in household income in the model). That is to say; either approach seems completely reasonable in isolation, but using a different approach in the two interventions favours GiveDirectly (because a given transfer spread across more people results in more utility overall, due to utility being a function of log income increase). In hindsight it is probably a bit harsh to describe this as an 'error' by GiveWell because it is a good-faith effort to capture the most important part of the model dynamics, but I also don't think it is unambiguously correct as you've indicated in your review document; there's a genuine inconsistency here. Overall I feel the same about most of the other areas you've highlighted - I was probably a bit over-harsh describing them as 'errors', but nevertheless they are potentially risky methodological steps which seem to have simpler and less risky alternative implementations.</p><p>Also on a small point of clarification - your comments in the linked document suggest that you are not worried about the hard-coded cells because they don't have any impact on calculations. Sorry if I wasn't clear in the text, but the main impact of hard coded cells is that the model becomes really hard to maintain - you won't have an intuitive sense about whether you can make certain changes or not, because certain calculations you might expect to take place actually won't happen because of the hard coding.</p>", "parentCommentId": "THB8hpW3HxzBseALa", "user": {"username": "Froolow"}}]
