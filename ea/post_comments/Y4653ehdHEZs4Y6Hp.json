I especially appreciate the \"what you find hard\" section. We really need more transparency about what successful people struggle with so that others, especially people who are just starting out, don't feel bad for having a bad day (or a week, month, etc.). I also believe it's valuable for other Forum users to see what happens behind the scenes, as many online products look like they \"just happen\" while many hours and people's energy go into them!&nbsp;<br>As an additional benefit, if any org decides to hire for a Content Specialist this post can be very useful!&nbsp;</p>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "sofiabalderson"}}]
