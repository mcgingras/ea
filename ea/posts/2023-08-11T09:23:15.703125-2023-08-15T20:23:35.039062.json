However, this still leaves open the question of what is good for insects \u2013 what sort of conditions are best for their welfare, and how we could assess how good their welfare is.</p><p>In this talk, Dr. Browning will discuss some potential methods for answering the question of what is good for insects, highlighting current knowledge gaps and the most urgent next steps for insect welfare research.&nbsp;</p>", "user": {"username": "Group Organizer"}}, {"_id": "4XNEnEr66ctzKMSzy", "title": "The impact of Animal Rising's Grand National disruption on public opinion", "postedAt": "2023-08-15T17:16:26.895Z", "htmlBody": "<p>Social movements have the power to drive large-scale social change, but the effectiveness of disruptive tactics in achieving this change is uncertain. This is especially true for the animal advocacy movement, where there is much less evidence on the impact of these tactics. To shed light on this debate, we conducted nationally representative surveys before and after the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/apr/15/grand-national-delay-start-animal-rights-protest-extinction-rebellion\">disruption of the Grand National horse-racing event</a> by Animal Rising. This event received huge amounts of media coverage and was one of the most publicised animal rights protest in recent UK history.</p><p>T\ufeffo our knowledge, this is the first time public opinion polling has been used to test the impact of a large-scale animal rights protest. As such, we believe it provides new insights into the dynamics of social movements and the role of radical activists in driving change for animals.</p><p>J\ufeffoin us to hear about the findings of this novel research and the implications for social movement actors, from campaigning groups to funders.

If you look at some countries within sub-Saharan Africa, they\u2019re like half of the sub-Saharan Africa average. So there you\u2019re talking about 100 times less than you\u2019d get in the UK or the US.</p><p><strong>Hannah Ritchie:</strong> So you put that in context: the value that an average farmer in the US might create in three to four days is the same as a Tanzanian farmer for the entire year.</p><p><strong>Luisa Rodriguez:</strong> Why is it so low in sub-Saharan Africa?</p><p><strong>Hannah Ritchie:</strong> I think there\u2019s a couple of reasons. One is that the farms are really small, so often the amount of crop or value you get out is quite low. And maybe we\u2019ll come onto crop yields. So with low crop yields, you get not that much out, but also, as you said, you can\u2019t afford machinery, or you can\u2019t afford fertilisers or pesticides, or things that would basically substitute for human power inputs. So it just means you need lots of hands on deck to keep the farm going and keep it at that baseline level of productivity. So you don\u2019t get much out, and you just need lots of people working on the farm.</p><p><strong>Luisa Rodriguez:</strong> OK, and then the other thing that seems to be really low here is land productivity. Which feels a bit more intuitive to me, is that basically how much crop yield you\u2019d get from, for example, an acre of land?</p><p><strong>Hannah Ritchie:</strong> Yeah, exactly. So it\u2019s like what most people would call a crop yield. So say we each have a hectare to grow wheat. If you got four tonnes, and I got two tonnes, your land productivity would be twice what I get. It\u2019s just how much you get from a unit of land. There\u2019s a couple of factors that come into it. One is, as you say, the quality of land. So the texture of the soil, the natural nutrient density, carbon content of the soil, how well it drains: all of these affect how well a crop will grow. But there are also ways that we can change some of those aspects. We can use irrigation or drainage to determine how much water is in the soil. Or we can apply our own nutrients for fertilisers. So there\u2019s natural conditions, but there\u2019s also inputs that we can use to change that.</p><p><strong>Luisa Rodriguez:</strong> Cool. OK, and again, I\u2019m guessing land productivity is much lower in sub-Saharan Africa. How much lower is it relative to other regions?</p><p><strong>Hannah Ritchie:</strong> Again, it\u2019s very low. One way we can compare is we would use cereal yields, because most regions grow some cereals. So if you compare the average in sub-Saharan Africa, it\u2019s about half that of India, which is less than half of the global average. So it\u2019s pretty poor. And then if you compare that to richer countries, it\u2019s like four to five times lower. But then again, there are countries within sub-Saharan Africa that will get half again of that regional average. So there are some countries where you\u2019re talking about getting 10 times less per unit of land than in rich countries.</p></blockquote><h3><strong>The sustainability equation</strong></h3><blockquote><p><strong>Luisa Rodriguez:</strong> I\u2019ve read the first few chapters of the book and really enjoyed it. Early on, you make the claim that kind of surprised me: that the world has actually never been sustainable. And I just found that really counterintuitive, until I read more about what you meant. Can you explain that?</p><p><strong>Hannah Ritchie:</strong> Sure. So I get that it\u2019s a controversial claim, and it does seem counterintuitive. I think probably where you came from on that initially, I\u2019m guessing you were thinking about purely environmental sustainability \u2014 where you\u2019re thinking about all of the big environmental problems that you face. So the rise in energy consumption and CO2 and plastic pollution, et cetera, has basically happened in the last 200 years or so \u2014 most of it probably in the last 50 years. So if you look at those trends, it\u2019s like all this bad stuff has happened in the last 50 years, and before it was all fine, and there were none of these problems. And that\u2019s where I also would have come from, from an environmental background. And I think when you frame it as that, there\u2019s a large amount of truth to the fact that our ancestors were sustainable. They didn\u2019t have really large environmental impacts. I would say that\u2019s mostly true. There are some areas\u2026 Like, it\u2019s not the case that they lived in perfect balance with nature.</p><p><strong>Luisa Rodriguez:</strong> Yeah. It does seem like one of those things that\u2019s really easy to romanticise. Like, Indigenous peoples didn\u2019t cause harm to the environment; they lived harmoniously with it or something.</p><p><strong>Hannah Ritchie:</strong> Yeah. And there\u2019s clear examples where there just were large impacts. One key one is if you look at the change in biodiversity \u2014 specifically mammal biodiversity \u2014 over time, you see that mammals have gotten smaller and smaller. This has been happening over millennia; this is not just the last two centuries. And a large part of that was overhunting, and the humans were hunting. And at the time, the populations were really, really small \u2014 like, talking about a global population of maybe 5 million at the time \u2014 and more than 100 of the world\u2019s largest mammal species went extinct. And most of that is thought to be through overhunting. So it\u2019s not the case that there was zero impact.</p><p>I actually accept the argument that, environmentally, our ancestors mostly lived with a very low environmental impact, and recently that\u2019s been knocked off. But where I would contest the sustainability part is, if you think about why their environmental impact was so low, it\u2019s because their populations were tiny. And the reason their populations were tiny is because child mortality was so high. Half of children were dying before reaching puberty, so you had really high fertility rates \u2014 lots of children being born, but half of them were dying \u2014 so you basically didn\u2019t really have population growth, and populations were tiny. So my contest there is: Is that really what we\u2019re saying sustainability is?</p><p>If you care about human suffering, to me, you also need to consider that in this definition we want to adopt of \u201csustainability.\u201d So I think my definition there is kind of the definition of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_development\">sustainable development</a>, which is a kind of newish but also controversial term for some people: we need to have low environmental impacts to protect future generations and other species, but we also need to meet the needs of the current generation. Like, we want to have low human suffering today, but also protect future generations and other species.</p><p>So to me, the sustainability equation has two halves there. And I think we\u2019ve never achieved both halves at the same time. Our ancestors might have achieved the environmental part, but they didn\u2019t achieve the human suffering part. We\u2019ve kind of flipped the other way, where we\u2019re doing much better on meeting human needs, but it\u2019s come at the cost of the environment. And my core argument in the book is that I think we could be the first generation that does achieve both at the same time, if we do the right things.</p></blockquote><h3><strong>How buying environmentally friendly technology in helps low-income countries</strong></h3><blockquote><p><strong>Hannah Ritchie:</strong> I think the economics and the political ends often go very closely together. I often get the question from people of changing individual behaviours. Like, what impact does it actually have? And am I wasting my time because it\u2019s all about systemic change? Or you hear this argument often from countries, some of them very rich \u2014 like the UK, for example, where people say the UK only emits 1% of carbon emissions; what we do just doesn\u2019t matter in the scheme of things. But the key argument I\u2019m making \u2014 whether it\u2019s talking about individual changes or changes for countries which now are quite small emitters \u2014 is that the impacts they have really have these large spillover impacts on policies, but also on the economics of the technologies.</p><p>So an example of that on an individual level is like, one way you can have additional impact is on the signal you\u2019re sending to policies \u2014 that you care about the environment, you care about climate change. But there\u2019s also a really strong technology economics signal you\u2019re sending, where if you buy an electric car, you\u2019re showing to the market, \u201cHey, there\u2019s a big market over here for people to serve. Come and serve us.\u201d Or installing solar power or buying meat substitutes instead: what you\u2019re doing there, as we discussed, we need to make these technologies cheaper for people in low-income countries, for them to have as the default option. And by buying those, you\u2019re basically bringing down the cost curve for all of these technologies. So your impact is way beyond your individual thing. It\u2019s like this collective pulling the market in a certain direction.</p><p><strong>Luisa Rodriguez:</strong> Right. OK, so the argument is something like, you might not think it\u2019s that important for you to buy an electric car from your own environmental perspective \u2014 because generally cars in the UK have technology built in them that means you won\u2019t be emitting loads, even if you have a non-electric car \u2014 but if loads of people in the UK buy electric cars, then the electric car technology just gets really good, and drives the price down. And if the price is low enough, other countries, lower- and middle-income countries, might eventually get to just go right to the electric car and skip over some of that intermediate step where they\u2019re polluting loads.</p><p><strong>Hannah Ritchie:</strong> Right. I mean, I think that wasn\u2019t strictly true, because cars in the UK might have lower local air pollutants, but they still emit a lot of carbon. So it\u2019s not that they don\u2019t have a lot of carbon. But yeah, that\u2019s the core of the argument: that basically what pulled these prices down was people buying them when they were really expensive. And that\u2019s the only reason that they\u2019ve come down in costs, is because they were being deployed because people were buying them when they were expensive. And we never would have seen these costs decline if we hadn\u2019t invested in them early.</p><p><strong>Luisa Rodriguez:</strong> I guess I had not had the visceral sense that rich people in California all buying Teslas was that important for the world. But I guess if it\u2019s creating this flow-through effect where it makes Teslas and the technology that makes Teslas possible much cheaper, then they will just eventually exist elsewhere in the world much sooner than they might have otherwise.</p><p><strong>Hannah Ritchie:</strong> Right. I mean, the price decline on these technologies is enormous. For example, if you look at batteries, the big hurdle for electric cars for a long time was the cost of the batteries. So if you go back to 1990, I <a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/battery-price-decline\">calculated the cost of a Tesla battery</a> that you\u2019d use in a Tesla car today would have cost like $1 million. And it now costs like $13,000.</p><p>So I often when I think about climate action, I\u2019ve been really frustrated by how slow progress has been, and it seems like we\u2019ve not been making progress. But when you think about the cost of these technologies a couple of decades ago, it\u2019s very obvious why weren\u2019t making a lot of progress. Like, no one was buying a car that costs \u00a31 million for the battery. And it\u2019s the same for solar and wind, for example. They were just way too expensive for the world to adopt.</p><p>And part of why I\u2019m so optimistic is because <a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/cheap-renewables-growth\">all of these technologies are now very cost-competitive</a>. It\u2019s just a completely different situation from where we were even a decade ago, where it just seemed completely unfeasible that the world would pay loads of money to install them. And now it just seems obvious, because they\u2019re actually, in many cases, cheaper. Like, <a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/solar-pv-prices\">the cost of solar panels has fallen by more than 90%</a> in the last decade. In the last <i>decade</i>.</p></blockquote><h3><strong>4 ways to change our food system to solve several environmental issues at once</strong></h3><blockquote><p><strong>Luisa Rodriguez:</strong> You said that we really need to kind of radically change our food system. I don\u2019t really know what that looks like.</p><p><strong>Hannah Ritchie:</strong> Yeah, I think it\u2019s probably not as complicated as it seems. There\u2019s just a couple of big, massive, low-hanging fruits. The biggest one is eating less meat and dairy, and there I would say specifically beef.</p><p><strong>Hannah Ritchie:</strong> [But] <a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/less-meat-or-sustainable-meat\">reducing meat consumption overall</a> \u2014 it\u2019s very obvious to me that we\u2019re not going to switch overnight, and we might just not get rid of meat consumption completely. Like, we might just always have a world where there\u2019s some meat consumption. So I think there\u2019s massive gains there from the meat that we do produce. There\u2019s definitely much better ways of doing that and much more efficient ways of doing it. So there\u2019s low-hanging fruit there in optimising where we produce the meat to reduce the environmental impact.</p><p>The third one is increasing crop yields, which just has massive environmental benefits.</p><p>And then the final really big one is just <a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/food-waste-emissions\">reducing food waste and losses</a>. And there\u2019s two components to it. One is what we call food \u201closses,\u201d which are almost unintentional losses. That often happens between the farm and reaching the consumer or the retail stage \u2014 where people don\u2019t want to lose the food because they\u2019re losing money, but it might go off because they can\u2019t afford refrigeration, or it\u2019s damaged in transport. So there\u2019s various reasons why you would unintentionally lose food. And actually, those losses are pretty high.</p></blockquote><h3><strong>Policy change doesn't have to be slow</strong></h3><blockquote><p><strong>Hannah Ritchie:</strong> I think one big lesson [from the ozone story] is just that, as you said, I think we often see these problems as inevitably, they\u2019re going to take a long time, and action just has to be slow. And I think there\u2019s this problem, but also some other specific examples, where change can happen faster if we actually put our minds to it. So I think it\u2019s not inevitable that progress on these has to be slow.</p><p>We addressed this relatively quickly. The acid rain story for many countries was also very fast. If you look at China, when China wants to take action, it works very quickly. And I\u2019m not saying that\u2019s a model that other countries can emulate, for various reasons. But there\u2019s just several examples where it\u2019s clear to me that it\u2019s not inevitable that they have to be slow.</p><p>I think often politicians or policymakers, for example, can get away with the argument of, \u201cIt\u2019s just going to take a long time. These things just take a long time.\u201d But I actually think if you can bring real examples where that\u2019s just not the case, then it\u2019s very hard for them to retreat from that. I always make this argument.</p><p>Coming back to earlier, where we were discussing relatively small emitters today and what role they can play in actually addressing climate change. There, I think there\u2019s a very clear example of if a country takes action and almost provides a model that other countries can follow, then it makes a massive impact. And there\u2019s the speed thing. For example, you see Norway: nearly all of the cars sold in Norway today are electric, which is just way ahead of anyone else in the world. And it\u2019s done that very quickly. So no other country can use the excuse that they can\u2019t scale electric vehicles very quickly, because we have examples that it\u2019s happening.</p><p><strong>Luisa Rodriguez:</strong> I guess Norway is really wealthy. So there will be barriers for many countries to doing that.</p><p><strong>Hannah Ritchie:</strong> Yeah, for the poorest by far, for sure, that\u2019s the case. But even in China, for example, more than a third of new cars sold in China are electric. I would expect within the next three years, maybe, it\u2019s going to be more than half of new cars sold. It\u2019s moving really quickly. So I think there will be examples.</p></blockquote>", "user": {"username": "80000_Hours"}}, {"_id": "h26mJ6JWmimc6xrox", "title":

", "postedAt": "2023-08-15T14:07:14.710Z", "htmlBody": "<p>How does one go about bringing change in an environment where the majority of the food consumed/ Cooked revolves around animals? If we manage to tackle the issue of getting people to treat animals better, it's bound to be a tough task \u2013 if not nearly impossible \u2013 to steer them away from their animal-based diet. I believe that the ultimate aim of treating animals with kindness is to put an end to their slaughter, which essentially is the core of animal rights.</p>\n<p>Now, here's the thing: the substitute they're providing\"Plant-based meat\" just doesn't quite measure up to the real deal. Where I come from, we're used to consuming all animal parts and a wide array of species, making it a real challenge to convince folks to cut back when the alternatives don't quite hit the mark taste-wise. And don't even get me started on the price \u2013 alternative meat protein tends to hit the wallet harder compared to the cheaper meat options they're used to. Convincing people that have been ingrained into meat eating to change to another protein giving that is more expensive than the previous is a hard task. Even when the majority are hit hard with life sickness that required not consuming meat, a lot of people find it hard/ impossible to abide by a given solution to their ailment( which includes stopping meat consumption). This depicts how people consume and like meat.\nA typical breakfast meal of people includes buying/cooking one scoop of rice and then adding fish, the head part of the meat, the intestine, the egg, the hard part, and others. Eating all these portrays richness and healthy living in our part of the world.</p>\n<p>The big question now is: what's the key factor to consider/ advocate for to get the desired outcome of effective contribution: animal welfare or animal rights? It's a real head-scratcher. Pushing for people to give up meat becomes a whole lot trickier when we don't have a better option in place. And let's face it, encouraging folks to treat animals well when the endgame is still putting them on the plate doesn't exactly fit together like pieces of a puzzle.</p>\n<p>Here's what boils down to cracking the code on animal welfare and rights in our African setting demands a full-fledged game plan. We've got to wholeheartedly embrace our cultural roots, keep a watchful eye on the financial side of things, and get into the nitty-gritty of taste preferences. And at the end of the day, our main mission is to establish a better, more balanced bond with the critters that coexist with us on this planet we share.\nSo, the big question is: what's the winning strategy to genuinely get folks on board in this complex scenario?</p>\n", "user": {"username": "Olamide"}}, {"_id": "nMzihtgFas5tN7C6c", "title": "Register your interest in helping to create advice on \"quitting your PhD effectively\"!", "postedAt": "2023-08-15T11:44:12.027Z", "htmlBody": "<p>I am looking to <strong>interview individuals who have exited their PhDs (at any given time) </strong><i><strong>and</strong></i><strong> are continuing to work towards an impactful career.</strong></p><p>If you are someone who has quit their PhDs and would like to help others who may be considering a similar career path, please register your interest in being interviewed <a href=\"https://forms.gle/Vm21y5k6UTR3xLk96\">here</a>.</p><p><strong>Background</strong></p><p>I have recently started a one-year break from PhD (August 1st) and have received EAIF funding to help me transition towards an impactful career. My PhD was focused on improving biosafety and biosecurity regulation in the global south, and I have decided to take a year off to consider several factors related to the decision of leaving it. While doing my PhD, I also was a coach at Effective Thesis helping people with thesis topics and career choices. I hope to leverage these two experiences together in writing up advice for those thinking about exiting PhDs.</p><p>In the process of quitting my PhD, I discovered that there are very few resources that actually help one think through this decision and that helps you continue working towards an impactful career path. When writing <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/2jWLvBH8abzscDbPs/announcing-effective-dropouts\">this post</a> last year as a joke with several others, I received many messages asking me to write up advice on how to dropout effectively.</p><p>As such, I will later post advice on \u201cHow to quit your PhD effectively\u201d. <strong>Rather than using my own experience as the only source of advice, I want to interview several (approximately 10) people who have left their PhDs and either switched to more impactful career paths or remained on an impactful career trajectory.</strong></p><p>My goal is to better understand the challenges that people face when making the decision to leave a PhD program, as well as the strategies and resources that can help individuals successfully transition into new careers.</p><p><strong>What will the interviews look like?</strong></p><p>I intend to have an online video call with all those who are interested for approximately 1.5 hours. These will be semi-structured interviews. Essentially, I will focus on three key phases of exiting your PhD. First, the decision-making process and how you ended up at that decision. Second, the technical processes of leaving your PhD and how you navigated that experience (e.g. dealing with supervisors, institutions or visa problems). Finally, I will ask you about your transition and what resources and strategies were useful in ensuring a really smooth transition towards your current career path (e.g. rest first, apply for jobs later or focus largely on your resume building or connections).</p><p>I will also be attending EAGxAustralia and EAGxPhilippines in case anyone wants to meet in person at those conferences.</p><p><strong>Timeline</strong></p><p>I hope to conduct all my interviews by mid-November and will leave this form open till mid-September (<i>approximately 15th September 2023</i>).

He says:&nbsp;</p><p>&gt; It\u2019s hard to predict what skills will be useful as AI advances further and new issues come up.</p><p>&gt; Being ready to switch careers when a big opportunity comes up could be hugely valuable - and hard. (Most people would have a lot of trouble doing this late in their career, no matter how important!)</p><p>He reiterated this idea recently on the<a href=\"https://80000hours.org/podcast/episodes/holden-karnofsky-how-ai-could-take-over-the-world/#what-people-with-an-audience-could-be-doing-differently-015938\"> 80,000 Hours Podcast</a>:&nbsp;</p><p>&gt; It might be worth emphasising that the ability to switch careers is going to get harder and harder as you get further and further into your career. So in some ways, if you\u2019re a person who\u2019s being successful, but is also making sure that you\u2019ve got the financial resources, the social resources, the psychological resources, so that you really feel confident that as soon as a good opportunity comes up to do a lot of good, you\u2019re going to actually switch jobs, or have a lot of time to serve on a board or whatever \u2014 it just seems incredibly valuable.</p><p>&gt; I think it\u2019s weird because this is not a measurable thing, and it\u2019s not a thing you can, like, brag about when you go to an effective altruism meetup. And I just wish there was a way to kind of recognise that the person who is successfully able to walk away, when they need to, from a successful career has, in my mind, more expected impact than the person who\u2019s in the high-impact career right now, but is not killing it.</p><p>I'd add a few things here:&nbsp;</p><p>1. It doesn't seem like you need to prioritize AI to think that this would be good for many people to do. Though this does seem especially important if you have a view of the world in which \"things are going to go crazy at some point\", because that makes longer-term high impact career planning harder, and you are more likely to think that l if you think AI risk is high, longer-term career planning is&nbsp;<strong>always hard&nbsp;</strong>and even if you think other problems are much more pressing you could still think that some opportunities will be much higher impact than others and will be hard to predict.</p><p>2. Many people have pointed out that we could use more experienced hands on many top problem areas. This is one way to help make that happen.</p><p>3. I think going into some mechanisms that account for why it's hard to switch careers later in your career could be useful:</p><ol><li>I think it's hard for more senior people to take an actual or perceived step down in level of responsibility, prestige, or compensation, because it feels like 'going backward.' But when you switch your career, you often need to take a step 'down' on some hierarchy and build back up.</li><li>Relatedly. people *really* don't want to have 'wasted time' so they are always very keen to be applying previous experience. Switching careers&nbsp;<strong>usually&nbsp;</strong>involves letting some of your previous experience 'go to waste'. We see this a lot at 80,000 Hours even in people in their 20s!&nbsp;</li><li>Stability in location and kind of work, as well as financial resources, get more valuable when people have children, or when they are supporting aging parents, both of which are more likely for people mid-career.</li><li>Social support \u2013 as Holden writes, it seems hard to brag about being ready to jump, since you won't have actually *done* anything.</li><li>Finally, it's hard to stay up to date! And switching careers when a high impact opportunity comes up requires noticing when it does and having&nbsp;<strong>confidence&nbsp;</strong>that it's actually a great opportunity. But if you're killing it as a senior infosec person in some industry you probably spend a lot of time doing great at that (not to mention being a mom of two teenagers or whatever) \u2013 are you reading the EA forum? Are you listening to the 80,000 Hours podcast, or reading the job board newsletter? There's too many developments to keep track of even for me, a childless full time professional EA, so yeah, I'm guessing no.</li></ol><h1>More on the proposal:</h1><p>The basic structure could be:&nbsp;</p><ol><li>A pledge that you will, for the rest of your career,&nbsp;<ol><li>Put some minimal effort into tracking what issues are most pressing and what opportunities there are to work on them</li><li>Maybe also commit to spending 1-2 days per year chatting to people about other work you could do // looking at a job board etc.?<ol><li>Seriously consider changing careers if something very promising comes up.&nbsp;</li></ol></li></ol></li><li>A community of fellow pledgers, who can&nbsp;<ol><li>Send each other and discuss opportunities</li><li>Help each other decide whether something is promising enough to jump</li><li>Support each other and help validate choices if someone does decide to 'jump' \u2013 providing advice and encouragement in the face of the psycho-social challenges above.</li><li>Provide a sense of community and valuing each others' commitments, as well as maybe be a source of friendship among people who share your values and are fellow badasses.</li></ol></li><li>A website or newsletter that would aim to keep pledgers up to date on job opportunities and developments in what issues are most pressing, to make keeping informed easier.</li><li>A vibe.</li></ol><p>It might also just help spread the meme that this is a good thing for people to be willing to do, making it generally more likely to happen even outside pledgers.&nbsp;</p><h1>Some downsides</h1><ol><li>Amorphous.

Introduction</strong></p><p>Longtermism is the notion that those who will live in the long-term future matter just as much, morally, as those beings that are alive today; that, although current conceptions of who society ought to care about appears restricted to living people, this understanding must change because there is, on society at large, a moral obligation to care, and to ensure that future people are able to live their lives satisfactorily.<a><sup><u>[1]</u></sup></a> MacAskill coined the term Longtermism in 2017, in a bid to help concretize the idea of caring about future people into one word that helped make it sound like a consequential movement.<a><sup><u>[2]</u></sup></a></p><p>This, however, is not to say that the ideas that longtermism espouses are particularly brand new.&nbsp; To the contrary, it has been admitted that longtermism builds on a rather long historical concern for future people.<a><sup><u>[3]</u></sup></a></p><p>A perception that may be gleaned is that longtermism is a \u2018Western\u2019 idea, so to speak. In this regard, one need not look further than the leading scholarship in this area,<a><sup><u>[4]</u></sup></a> where most of the literature comes from, who it talks about, and the solutions espoused<a><sup><u>[5]</u></sup></a> \u2013 all seem to originate from Western perspectives. Consequently, longtermism could perhaps mistakenly be seen as a completely novel concept emerging from the West, and its recent surge in popularity only serves as evidence to this notion.<a><sup><u>[6]</u></sup></a> .&nbsp;</p><p>In this piece, I seek to illustrate how Islam, and the initial flagbearers of Islam,<a><sup><u>[7]</u></sup></a> have historically preached tenets of longtermism, despite the religion finding inception some several centuries ago.<a><sup><u>[8]</u></sup></a> In fact, I will show in this piece that, not only is there a moral obligation on societies to care about future people, but that Islam, the Prophet, the Caliphs and even its prominent leaders place this obligation as one that is of great importance. This will be done with the following end in mind: that to convince Muslims to think in longtermist ways, the best method will be to find evidence that the idea finds some backing within Islamic teaching.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>II. Justifying the Study and Laying Groundwork</strong></p><p>At the very onset, one may question the very utility of this piece, by questioning why involving an Islamic perspective is at all necessary. In other words, what are the ramifications of an Islamic viewpoint of longtermism? In response to such argumentative resistance, one may merely resort to stating that this discussion is important for its own sake. That may be true. However, there are certainly a deeper reasons. &nbsp;</p><p>Since its inception in 2017, when MacAskill offered the term \u2018longtermism\u2019, the main impetus pushing him to coin this word, essentially, was to make it appealing as a movement.<a><sup><u>[9]</u></sup></a> He opined that the previous renditions of phrases and terms that were used to appeal to longtermism, as we now know it, were \u2018a mishmash\u2019. The entire point of the term and its meaning, was to make it \u2018attractive\u2019 as a movement for the wider public.<a><sup><u>[10]</u></sup></a> From the foregoing, it becomes clear that the conceptualizers of the term sought to find ways to make longtermism appeal to the public, presumably so that the movement gains support. In fact, it could be said that various undertakings have since occurred to do just that: increase the movements following. Whether using moral arguments, or other ideological arguments, much has been done to try and popularise the longtermist thought.&nbsp;</p><p>Some discussion, on the Effective Altruism Forum, as well as other informal platforms, has taken place on how it may be possible to bring in the Christian contingent onboard to the idea of Effective Altruism and longtermism.<a><sup><u>[11]</u></sup></a> But, this avenue, using the Christian religion to garner longtermist support, appears to face some sort of resistance.&nbsp;This is well summarized by Dominic Roser in his three-part sub-claim \u2013&nbsp;Christians are discouraged from worrying about the future, the future is determined only by God, and it He who already has plans for it.<a><sup><u>[12]</u></sup></a> In fact, there exists scholarship on how compatible longtermism is with Christianity.<a><sup><u>[13]</u></sup></a></p><p>Despite this, albeit constricted discussion on the Christian compatibility with longtermism, (almost) no work has been produced making the case on how Muslim\u2019s can be brought on board with the ideology. This is surprising, given that, if one can successfully make the case that Islam places a duty on its followers to care about future generations, the movement is likely to see success. Islam is one of the fastest growing religions, if not the fastest growing religion as claimed by Pew Research.<a><sup><u>[14]</u></sup></a> Current numbers illustrate that North of two billion people subscribe to Islam, equating to nearly 25% of the global population.<a><sup><u>[15]</u></sup></a> As such, with the large numbers associated with Islam, the inclusion of Islamic viewpoints into the conversations and discussions around effective altruism and longtermism is important.&nbsp;</p><p>Therefore, for the simple reason that Islam has a large contingent of followers, it is important that one attempt to make the case that these 2 billion people are compelled, by their teachings to be longtermist thinkers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>In this piece I make the case that these longtermist ideas about future people, the importance of avoiding extinction, and future people in general, were already part of Islamic thought 1400 years ago. I intend to illustrate how Islam, and the initial flagbearers of Islam,<a><sup><u>[16]</u></sup></a> have historically preached tenets of longtermism, despite the religion finding inception some several centuries ago.<a><sup><u>[17]</u></sup></a>&nbsp;Highlighting the link between Islam and longtermism could potentially attract Muslims to embrace the Effective Altruism movement and its longtermist principles.</p><p>It must be understood, at this juncture, that Islamic law (shariah), essentially, comes from various areas, principal of which is known as the Qur\u2019an, and the <i>Sunnah</i>. The Qur\u2019an is well-known and therefore merits little discussion. This is particularly because, the Quran is unequivocal in the importance of the book to Muslims: \u201cThis [Qur'an] is a clear statement to [all] the people and a guidance and instruction for those conscious of Allah\u201d.<a><sup><u>[18]</u></sup></a>&nbsp;The <i>sunnah&nbsp;</i>is a lesser-known part of Islamic law which entails a word spoken, or an act done, or a confirmation given by the Holy Prophet.<a><sup><u>[19]</u></sup></a><i>Sunnah&nbsp;</i>is a critical facet of Shariah Law. In fact, the Qur\u2019an makes various mentions of this. To mention a few:&nbsp;\u201cBelieve in Allah and His Messenger and the light which He sent down\u201d;<a><sup><u>[20]</u></sup></a> \u201cBelieve in Allah and His Messenger, the unlettered Prophet.\u201d (Qur\u2019an, 7:158);<a><sup><u>[21]</u></sup></a> \u201cTake what the Messenger brings you\u201d,<a><sup><u>[22]</u></sup></a> among many other commands from God.<a><sup><u>[23]</u></sup></a><i>Sunnah,&nbsp;</i>therefore, is taken to be an extension of the Qur\u2019an.&nbsp;In fact, the very word chosen, <i>sunnah,&nbsp;</i>literally translates to \u2018the path\u2019 or \u2018the way\u2019 and has been used in the Qur\u2019an to mean \u2018the ways of God\u2019.<a><sup><u>[24]</u></sup></a> This, then, is the importance placed on the <i>sunnah&nbsp;</i>of the Holy Prophet Muhammad.&nbsp;</p><p>That said, it becomes clear that two things, so far, merit interest: one, that Muslims must follow the teachings and wordings of the Qur\u2019an; second to that, the <i>sunnah&nbsp;</i>of the Prophet is of critical importance to the Muslim people. But there is one more area to mention, that stems from the saying of the Prophet. Cognizant of his impending mortality, the Prophet underscored the importance of the words, reports and acts of his immediate successors, the <i>Khalifa&nbsp;</i>(or caliphs)<i>.</i> Just before his death, the Prophet counselled his companions one last time, upon their request. Therein, the Prophet stressed, inter alia, two things: one, the importance of following his <i>sunnah;&nbsp;</i>second, he was unequivocal about keeping to the<i>sunnah&nbsp;</i>of the <i>khulafah ar-rashideen,&nbsp;</i>or the rightly guided caliphs.<a><sup><u>[25]</u></sup></a> From the foregoing, one learns that, not only is the way of the Prophet important for Muslims to take heed of, but so, too, is the <i>sunnah&nbsp;</i>of the caliphs.&nbsp;</p><p>From the foregoing, one can reasonably conclude, that if the Qur\u2019an, the <i>Sunnah&nbsp;</i>of the Prophet, or the caliphs, or <i>shari\u2019ah&nbsp;</i>law discusses, or places importance on the moral obligation of caring for future people, then, by extension, all Muslims <i>must</i> also follow suit. At the very least, if it can be shown that those sources even thought about future people and their wellbeing, then by that very nature, it is incumbent on all Muslims to think just as deeply about the wellbeing of future people.</p><p><strong>III. Guardians of the Future: Longtermist Obligations in Islamic Thought</strong></p><p>Hillary Greaves and MacAskill have postulated that that decision making in EA must be premised on two factors: (a) every option that is near-best overall is near-best for the far future; and (b) every option that is near-best overall presents significantly more benefits to far future people, than it does to near future people.<a><sup><u>[26]</u></sup></a> From here, one thing is clear \u2013&nbsp;there is a significant importance placed on not just decision making, but decision making that maintains the interest of those in the far future.</p><p>According to longtermists, another important tenet of longtermism is that extinction of human species must be avoided at all costs, and in the inverse, the human species must perpetuate.<a><sup><u>[27]</u></sup></a>&nbsp; It is quite easy to see why this is the case: after all, no decision matters, if future people cease to exist. Longtermists stress on the importance of preventing any risk that could exacerbate the odds of humanity going into extinction. To put a term to this phenomena, Nick Bostrom discusses \u2018existential risk\u2019.<a><sup><u>[28]</u></sup></a> This is a risk \u201cthat threatens the premature extinction of Earth-originating intelligent life or the permanent and drastic destruction of its potential for desirable future development.\u201d<a><sup><u>[29]</u></sup></a> In other words, anything that could potentially end human existence, is an existential risk, and it must be prevented at all costs.&nbsp;<a><u>[0073]</u></a>&nbsp;By way of providing concrete examples as to what would constitute an existential risk, one could consider catastrophic incidents relating to climate change, nuclear war, bioterrorism, the misuse of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), etc. Interestingly, the worst aspect is not that the foregoing events may cost the lives of billions of people who are alive at that time; rather it is that the potential of humanity\u2019s future existence would be stopped, trillions of potential future lives would be lost, and that a great amount of potential achievements by the human race would never occur.<a><sup><u>[30]</u></sup></a> From the foregoing discussion, it is clear that for longtermism, the perpetuity of the human race is a <i>necessity.&nbsp;</i>That this is a <i>necessity&nbsp;</i>ought to be stressed and kept in mind for later discussions in this post.&nbsp;</p><p>It must be noted that there are perhaps many more features of longtermism, and in the interest of full disclosure, I merely chose to discuss a few, such that this piece is concise. From the foregoing chapter, two things about longtermism seem to stand out further: one, that longtermism is centered around the idea that future people matter as much as those that are living; two, that, as living human beings, we owe a duty to ensure that future people not only exist, but they thrive (and whether they will thrive is based on what we do today). It follows then, that if Islam were preaching longtermism, or at least a type of longtermist thought, first, there must be evidence that Islam has placed on its followers the moral obligation to care about future people in a way that shows that they matter as much those in the present. Once that is shown, it must also be shown as to whether Islamic Shari\u2019ah has placed certain guidelines to ensure how that ought to be done. In later parts, this piece will seek to do just that \u2013 to show that Islam places an obligation to care about future people, and that Islam actually shows how that ought to be done.&nbsp;</p><p>It can be said that future generations were kept in mind when the Prophet was carrying out his mandate to spread Islam. To be precise, he has been quoted saying that those who believed in Islam were blessed; but those who believe in Islam without seeing the Prophet (future people, essentially) are an extraordinary <i>seven times&nbsp;</i>more blessed.<a><sup><u>[31]</u></sup></a> From this Hadith, not only is the fact that the Prophet acknowledged future people and future Muslims, but he essentially declared that those in the future are far more superior (and blessed). A Muslim may ask themselves a simple question: if these people were seven times more blessed, then isn\u2019t it incumbent on them to ensure that they safeguard the interest of this blessed people? The answer, in my opinion, would be a resounding yes. Interestingly, he merely said that those who did not see him and believed were blessed; they could be people born a hundred million years after his death. This is not a solitary time when the Prophet specifically thought of future generations.</p><p>Another instance that comes to mind is when the Prophet talked of the <i>Quraysh</i>, a tribe that opposed Islam. He said, \u201cI do hope that Allah will bring forth from their progeny those who would worship Allah alone and not associate partners with Him\".<a><sup><u>[32]</u></sup></a> From this, it is clear that future people were of great importance to the Prophet, and his actions had them in mind. Or at the very least, that he acknowledged that future people would exist, and because he would not be there to guide them, his recorded actions would be used as an example for future people. And so from these examples it becomes evident that, the leading flag bearer of Islam, the Prophet, cared or at the very least, kept future people in mind, during his life several centuries ago.&nbsp;</p><p>Another instance that illustrates that Muslim\u2019s 1400 years ago demonstrated an awareness for the people in the future comes from a hadith regarding one of the Caliphs of Islam.<a><sup><u>[33]</u></sup></a> Shortly following the death of the Prophet, his immediate successor, Abu Bakr, ordered one Zaid Ibn Thabit, to make a collection of Quranic verses in 632 AD.<a><sup><u>[34]</u></sup></a> Admittedly, the primary and immediate reason for the collecting and putting down Quranic verses in writing can be understood from the context of how the whole situation played out. Before Ibn Thabit was tasked with collecting the verses, the Muslims had been through a bloody battle \u2013 the Battle of Yemama.<a><sup><u>[35]</u></sup></a> Here, the Muslims lost various men who had memorized the Qur\u2019an. After this, based on the counsel of Abu Bakr\u2019s companions, and with the cognizance that the words of God may be lost, the collection of Quranic verses was ordered for. However, it has been argued, understandably, that the fear of losing the verses was problematic because future generations would not get access to the Qur\u2019an.</p><p>Even when it came to issues such as land distribution after the spoils of war won by Muslims, there is clear indication that there was deep thought about progeny. This can be exemplified by a scenario where, <i>Umar ibn Khatab</i>, one of the Caliphs of Islam, declared that spoils of war would not go solely to the victors. Instead, he said that he would preserve land and weaponry such that future generations would benefit. The exact quote is rather critical given that it is explicit in mentioning, \u2018future generations\u2019: \"But for the future generations, I would have distributed the land of the villages I conquer among the soldiers\u2026\". Here, the Caliphs decision making illustrated exactly what MacAskill and Greaves suggested about decision making:<a><sup><u>[36]</u></sup></a> he made a decision that was best for people of future generations, and second, that the option he picked presented significantly more benefits for future people, as opposed to living people. And so, this is yet another example of the fact that indeed, that historically, Islam, and Muslims of the time by extension, have had the needs of future people well in mind.</p><p>After having shown that future people are of concern, Islamically speaking, the next part of this section goes into show how Islam places importance on ensuring that future people live well and thrive.&nbsp;</p><p>To longtermists, the conservation of the environment remains critical. But specifically, it is unimpeachable that a tenet of longtermism is leaving for future generations a habitable and good Earth. Among the many tenets discussed in longtermist literature, risks emanating from climate related disasters remain ever present. It can be said that the reason for this is that a climate related disaster has the potential to end humanity as we know it.<a><sup><u>[37]</u></sup></a> In fact, according to Nick Beckstead, merely recognizing that climate change as a critical risk, and instituting plans to deal with the risk was a significant step.<a><sup><u>[38]</u></sup></a> Moreover, threats such as climate change are said to have been the impetus for the need for a campaign stronger than mere \u2018sustainability\u2019.<a><sup><u>[39]</u></sup></a> Clearly then, environmental conservation, and the curbing of climate change is at the forefront of longtermism, or at least, it is a crucial factor of consideration. However, for good measure, it must also be made clear that there is debate on the longtermism forum over whether climate change presents an \u2018existential risk\u2019 in and of itself.<a><sup><u>[40]</u></sup></a> Nonetheless, what is agreed upon is that for future generations, should a good Earth be left.</p><p>Islam places critical impetus on Muslims to ensure that the Earth is left clean and proper for future generations, with conservation being on the forefront.&nbsp; Islamically, all that is bestowed on Earth is said to be a \u2018gift\u2019 from God or an <i>\u2018Amaanah\u2019</i>.<a><sup><u>[41]</u></sup></a> Because of the same, it is said that none can misuse and waste the gifts from God. When it comes to the environment, this is no different. It has been strictly prohibited by God Himself, and later the Prophet Muhammad (the Prophet), for instance, to be wasteful in any regard, including with environmental resources. The Qur\u2019an is explicit when God says:</p><blockquote><p><i>\u2018O Children of Adam! Wear your beautiful apparel at every time and place of prayer: Eat and drink: But waste not by excess, for Allah loveth not the wasters\u2019.</i><a><i><strong><sup><u>[42]</u></sup></strong></i></a></p></blockquote><p>As regards the Prophet, he has been quoted saying \u201cDo not waste water, even if you are at a running stream\u201d.<a><sup><u>[43]</u></sup></a> It is further said by God, that all that is on Earth has been put in trust of human beings, and as beneficiaries, we must therefore protect its rights.<a><sup><u>[44]</u></sup></a> On the same, the Qur\u2019an states that God offered the trust of the nature to the mountains, but they declined to bear it; when humans were asked the same, they accepted.<a><sup><u>[45]</u></sup></a> There are many other revelations from God, and quotes from the Prophet. And so, what exactly do these verses and declarations mean?&nbsp;</p><p>The foregoing has been interpreted to mean, obviously, that we must protect the environment and the Earth at all costs, given that it is an <i>Amanah&nbsp;</i>(a trust).<a><sup><u>[46]</u></sup></a> But bearing more weight to the context of this piece, scholars have further agreed that the duty to protect the environs of Earth is one placed on the living, such that those who may live in the future are guaranteed to benefit from God\u2019s gift. In fact, Bagader et al. were categorical in their interpretation of the foregoing verses, and the idea that the Earth is a gift to mankind. In their view, the conservative use of nature and the gift of God is not reserved for \u2018one generation above other generations\u2019.<a><sup><u>[47]</u></sup></a> To the contrary, living beings must ensure they utilize the environment in a way that keeps in mind the interests of future generations.<a><sup><u>[48]</u></sup></a> In other words, Islam prohibits excessively using the environment for the sole benefit of living beings. Instead, everyone must conserve natural resources for the benefit of all people \u2013 living and future people. It is common knowledge that the exacerbation of climate change, and among the critical reasons for a potential climate disaster, is the excessive utilization of resources.<a><sup><u>[49]</u></sup></a> And so, Islam has, in essence, placed obligations on beings to ensure that climate change is not an issue, by ordaining that resources be used conservatively. Further credence regarding the Earth being for future generations is found by scholars in their interpretation of the verse:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p><i>\u2018It is God who has made for you the Earth\u2019.</i><a><i><strong><sup><u>[50]</u></sup></strong></i></a></p></blockquote><p>Here, \u2018you\u2019 has been interpreted to mean \u201cthe earth is not created only for one generation of creatures but for every generation: past, present, and future.\u201d<a><sup><u>[51]</u></sup></a></p><p>So, environmentally speaking, Islam has placed on its followers a deep moral obligation to ensure that the same is conserved for future generations, in one way or the other, with the ultimate goal that humans leave a good Earth for future generations to benefit from. Anything to the contrary would be a violation of the teachings of Islam. Interestingly, these verses that impart onto Muslim\u2019s an obligation to care about the environmental concerns of future generations were revealed over 1400 years ago.&nbsp;</p><p>But there is much more than mere environmental conservation. Shari\u2019ah is a branch of Islamic canon law. It is believed to be the total of what God ordained to be the set of rules, values, and laws that must be followed.<a><sup><u>[52]</u></sup></a> It is said that, if one were to do as Shari\u2019ah prescribes, they would be granted a place in heaven. So, there is great importance placed on Shari\u2019ah. After all, if one were to be faithful to the rules of Shari\u2019ah, they would go to heaven. And so, if it can be shown that Shar\u2019iah prescribes a moral obligation to care about future, surely, my point will be made clear.&nbsp;</p><p>Deeper investigation of the Shari\u2019ah and its objectives reveal how critical future generations are to the success of Shari\u2019ah. Notably, Shari\u2019ah seeks to safeguard necessities or <i>\u2018dharuriyyat\u2019.&nbsp;</i>It has been said, that the necessities, in Shari\u2019ah are: protection of life, property or wealth, health, religion, <i>lineage and progeny</i>, and dignity.<a><sup><u>[53]</u></sup></a> It ought to be further noted that everything propagated and proposed by Islam seeks, intrinsically, to protect these necessities.<a><sup><u>[54]</u></sup></a> Said differently, the protection of property, health, progeny, dignity and life is at the forefront of everything Islam seeks to protect. In the interesting of protecting the necessities, Ibn Ashur posits that there are two ways to do so: first, there must be the legalization of all measures to ensure that these interests are protected and preserved for not just individuals, but for the whole community;<a><sup><u>[55]</u></sup></a> and second, \u2018protect these interests and entities from destruction by preventing anything that can violate, damage, or destroy these entities\u2019.<a><sup><u>[56]</u></sup></a> So sacred, in fact, is the protection of the necessities, that Islam places stringent deterrents as far as exile for some who seek to steer the proverbial ship away from strongly protecting the necessities. It is therefore clear that these <i>dhuriyyat&nbsp;</i>are extremely sacrosanct. That we must protect progeny (or <i>nasl</i>), life, property, dignity, and the religion.&nbsp;</p><p>With this view, even a superficial look reveals something important: that Shari\u2019ah seeks to protects lineage and progeny. This essentially means that Shari\u2019ah is not only aware that there will be future people, but it seeks to ensure that those people are protected, and by extension, their interests, safeguarded. But, for progeny to exist at all, Islam would have to emphasize on the need to procreate, such that there actually are generations to protect. It does so variously. For instance, the Prophet has been quoted saying that he would be proud of an <i>ummah&nbsp;</i>(community) with great numbers, and so he encouraged marriages and offspring.<a><sup><u>[57]</u></sup></a> To briefly connect this with longtermism, Will MacAskill is also of the opinion that having kids is an important part of furthering the cause of longtermism.<a><sup><u>[58]</u></sup></a> The discussion here then becomes: if Islam encourages creating humans, it follows, one, that there is an active awareness to the fact that future people will exist, and two, that if they will exist, then, Shari\u2019ah must ensure (and its rules ensure) that their lives and livelihood are both protected, because protection of life is one of its key objectives. Thus, a big part of the Shari\u2019ah law is pegged on the perpetuation of the human species, and the avoidance of total extinction.<a><sup><u>[59]</u></sup></a></p><p>Shariah seeks to ensure, inter alia, the protection of life. However, this is not reserved for the living life alone. It is simply that Shari\u2019ah exists to protect life.&nbsp; And so, if it exists to protect life, would this not follow that both existing life and future potential lives all matter, and are worthy of protection? On face value, one may argue that it does not say it places a moral obligation on future lives, either. However, that it does is especially clear if further considerations are put on how much emphasis is placed on the continuity of the human species and the avoidance of extinction, as mentioned earlier, and the overall subsidiary objectives of Shari\u2019ah.&nbsp;</p><p>Generally, decision making, and the consequences thereafter are critical in Islam. Even on the most basic level, Muslims are aware that every decision they make can either lead them to heaven or hell in the hereafter. Simply, that every decision and every act following the decision is a good deed, or a bad deed.<a><sup><u>[60]</u></sup></a> The argument here will be as follows: if future generations matter, morally, in Islam, it follows that decision makers must ensure that decisions they take are with the best interest of the progeny, who matter morally, and are worthy of protection. In fact, in doing so, one would be following the <i>sunnah&nbsp;</i>of Umar ibn Khattab, who clearly made decisions based on what was best for future generations.<i>&nbsp;</i>Islam, therefore, is a religion which takes consequences of actions very seriously (almost as if it subscribes to a consequentialist thought). In fact, in this regard, Al Shatbi writes:</p><blockquote><p><i>Examining the consequences of actions is consistent with the objectives of the Shari\u2018ah, whether the actions concerned are in accordance with or contrary to the Shari\u2018ah. Therefore, the mujtahid does not judge an action performed by a legally responsible individual, whether it is one of commission or omission, until he has examined the action\u2019s resultant consequences.</i><a><i><strong><sup><u>[61]</u></sup></strong></i></a></p></blockquote><p>Therefore, examining consequences of actions \u2013 all actions \u2013 is important. And because Islam has historically placed importance on future people, it follows that one ought to consider the consequences of their actions with future people in mind, as did the Caliphs, and the Prophet.&nbsp;</p><p>At the very basic level, and in summation, as long as the reader is convinced that one, the Prophet and the Caliphs were aware and cared about future people, they must also be convinced that Islam places an obligation to care about future people. This arises from the very basic idea that in Islam, what the prophet did is <i>sunnah,&nbsp;</i>and his <i>sunnah&nbsp;</i>(teachings) ought to be followed.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>IV. Conclusion</strong></p><p>As discussed very early on in this post, getting Muslims on board with the idea of longtermism would be a fundamental step to the growth of the longtermist movement. This post sought to illustrate just how one can get the Muslim contingent to join the movement. In saying so, the author opined that this can be done, if one can illustrate that what longtermism stands for, is exactly in line with what Islam and Islamic law stands for.&nbsp;</p><p>In pursuit of doing exactly that, the piece outlined evidence that future generations were well within the mind of the Prophet. Not just that, but the Prophet thought that the generations to come were much more blessed. Further evidence from the Qur\u2019an, and the <i>sunnah&nbsp;</i>of the rightly guided caliphs shows concern for future people. Most convincing is the action of the Caliph who made a decision that benefitted those to come much more than those who lived. Shari\u2019ah law outlines, within the necessities, the importance of progeny, and protecting progeny. It places great importance on decision making.&nbsp;</p><p>Based on the premise that a Muslim must follow the Qur\u2019an, the <i>Sunnah</i>, and the Shari\u2019ah, it follows that a true Muslim must think and care for future people. It is also clear that for a Muslim, future people matter as much, morally, as do living people.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><br>&nbsp;</p><hr><p><a><sup><u>[1]</u></sup></a>&nbsp;MacAskill W, \u2018Longtermism\u2019, Effective Altruism Forum, 26 July 2019 \u2014 &lt;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/qZyshHCNkjs3TvSem/longtermism\"><u>https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/qZyshHCNkjs3TvSem/longtermism</u></a>&gt; on 16 September 2022.&nbsp;</p><p><a><sup><u>[2]</u></sup></a>&nbsp;MacAskill W, \u2018Longtermism\u2019, Effective Altruism Forum, 26 July 2019.</p><p><a><sup><u>[3]</u></sup></a>&nbsp;Moorhouse F, \u2018Longtermism: An Introduction\u2019, Effective Altruism Forum, 27 January 2021 &lt;<a href=\"https://www.effectivealtruism.org/articles/longtermism\"><u>https://www.effectivealtruism.org/articles/longtermism</u></a>&gt; on 17 September 2022.</p><p><a><sup><u>[4]</u></sup></a>&nbsp;Most of the scholars who write on longtermism and are popular for doing so are Western writers such as Nick Bostrom, Will MacAskill, Hillary Greaves, and Nick Beckstead.&nbsp;</p><p><a><sup><u>[5]</u></sup></a>&nbsp;Solutions provided to issues such as X-Risk are often centered around the capabilities of the West.

In this post I revisit that controversial topic.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Theory of change</strong></p><p><u>Food production&nbsp;</u><br>&nbsp;</p><p>Agricultural land redistribution is a reform in which large farms are broken up and distributed to tenants or landless peasants. The original author\u2019s central argument for the potential impact of land redistribution is that redistribution creates smaller farms and there's some evidence that smaller farms have higher yields and higher per-acre yields resulting in a higher total output.</p><p><u>Wealth</u></p><p>The original authors don't focus on what I'd expect is the more important impact:<i> the poor will be richer.</i>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://blog.givewell.org/2016/12/06/why-i-mostly-believe-in-worms/\"><u>GiveWell&nbsp;</u></a>illustrates the centrality of wealth for impact: GiveWell\u2019s recommendation of deworming charities is driven by size of the income gain, even though the evidence on deworming is&nbsp;<a href=\"https://blog.givewell.org/2016/07/26/deworming-might-huge-impact-might-close-zero-impact/\"><u>ambiguous</u></a>, as it currently appears to be for land redistribution. Comparably, GiveDirectly is itself a wealth transfer.<br>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Tractability</strong></p><p><u>South Asia</u></p><p>The original authors (the authors) weakly held the view that South Asia is the best region to attempt land redistribution today: South Asia exhibits a high degree of land inequality, a large (and in some areas politically influential) class of poor farmers, and a modest history of land reform.</p><p>The authors may not have realised just how tractable land redistribution in South Asia could be. Since Indian independence, there has been voluntary and state initiated/mediated land reforms in several South Asian states. The most notable and successful example of land reforms are in the Indian states of West Bengal and Kerala.&nbsp;</p><p><u>Delivery partners</u></p><p>There are multiple communist parties in India however the largest is the Communist Party of India (Marxist). The Communists have been in Government in Kerala since 1957 have been routinely voted into power by championing the politics of radical land redistribution and rapid advances in literacy. Previously, West Bengal was ruled by a communist alliance for over three decades where land was distributed amongst 2.4 million landless and poor farmers.</p><p><u>Track record</u></p><p>As noted by the original authors, when redistribution has succeeded globally it has been accompanied by extensive agricultural support, such as rural infrastructure development, subsidies for fertilizers and high-yield seeds, agronomic training, and cheap credit. I am no expert and these facts are worth checking but have read that im Kerala, the Communists produced a 95 percent literacy rate, the highest in India, the highest HDI of any state in India (0.784), the second-smallest poverty rate in India (behind the small state of Goa), the highest life expectancy in India (77 years) and the second-most urbanized state in India (47.7%; behind Goa).&nbsp;</p><p><u>Room for more advocacy</u></p><p>Radical land reforms in Kerala were first led under&nbsp;<i>Kerala Land Reforms (Amendment) Act, 1969</i> which abolished the right to use farmland in exchange for rent. However, redistribution itself was slow and the Government by 1988 had distributed only 25000 hectares which accounted for 3.2% of the promised available land. There remains significant room for advocating further redistribution that could be explored by further investigation in detail for relative cost-effectiveness with other opportunities.</p><p><u>Donation opportunities</u></p><p>One of the central reasons the original authors did not recommend investigating land redistribution further was their observation that there appear to be no large and reputable NGOs that advocate for radical land redistribution. There are however large and reputable \u2018government\u2018 organizations that advocate for radical redistribution: the aforementioned Indian communists.</p><p>I don\u2019t know why there aren\u2019t known land redistribution Non-Government Organizations but I suspect that may be because Marxists are often critical of charity and marxist have played significant roles in land redistribution efforts. What that could mean for whether an appropriate NGO could be started by Effective Altruists, or whether Communist would be willing, lawfully able and willing to use foreign donations requires further thought if this cause is investigated further.<br>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Scale - population&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Of the 1.2 billion people worldwide living in dollar poverty, over 43 percent are found in South Asia. Of these, 970 million (72 percent) live in rural areas. Approximately 150 million households, with 751 million people, can be classed as agricultural.</p><p><u>Animals</u></p><p>A considerable number of small ruminants could also be affected by land reforms. The rice farming system is concentrated in Bangladesh and West Bengal, with smaller areas in Kerala. The rice farming system contains 50 million bovines, used for draft power, milk and manure.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Neglectedness: poverty and malnutrition&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Despite improvements in national food security over the last three decades, benefits have not yet reached the entire population of the region. The UN FAO estimates that 254 million people are still undernourished.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Risks</strong></p><p>Violence&nbsp;</p><p>In 2019, a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/ktEfsoGfBFGsaiY46/overview-of-capitalism-and-socialism-for-effective-altruism\"><u>forum post on communism and socialism for Effective Altruists</u></a> broadly concluded that there is&nbsp; good evidence against socialist ideas. The degree to which those concerns generalize and or could spill over here requires attention. The potential impacts of funding a communist organisation on regional and world politics should also be considered, with India neighboring communist China -&nbsp; a rival to the US, and the US has been good to effective altruism.</p><p>Conversely, between 1950 and 1980, under Mao's influence, China experiencing the most rapid sustained increase in life expectancy of any population in documented global history, attributable mainly to public health and education campaigns.&nbsp;</p><p>There are complicated spill overs from land reform initiatives in India in particular. Tribal people have lost their land through redistribution (including the aforementioned redistribution efforts led by other non-Maoist communists) to either to non-tribals or to the state-led development projects. Maoist insurgents in India have successfully mobilized people against acquisition of their land by non-tribals and the state and there seems to be a strong negative correlation between the successful implementation of land reform measures and Maoist activity. Hoever there is limited evidence and mixed reports about the guerrillas governance of captured territory on food security and redistribution to tribals. Armed conflict between the Indian state and Maoists since 1997 has seen an estimated 6000-8000 civilians killed.&nbsp;</p><p>Please note, the term tribals strikes me as insensitive as a foreigner, but it appears to be the standard term.

By providing competitive alternatives, these products might displace the consumption of animal-based meats. Since cultivated meats are not currently widely available on the public market, this paper will focus on plant-based meats, although many of the arguments might also apply to cultivated meats.</p>\n<p>Animal welfare, environmental, and public health advocates believe plant-based meats present a valuable opportunity to mitigate significant negative externalities of industrial animal agriculture, like animal suffering, greenhouse gas emissions, and antimicrobial resistance. For example, Animal Charity Evaluators lists \"[cultivated] and plant-based food tech\" as a priority cause area (Animal Charity Evaluators, 2022b), and a 2018 survey of 30 animal advocacy leaders and researchers ranked creating plant-based (and cultivated) meats third (after only research and corporate outreach) in their top priorities (Savoie, 2018). Non-profits working to research and support plant-based and cultivated meat production have received millions of dollars in funding (Animal Charity Evaluators, 2022a; New Harvest, 2021). Hu et al. (2019) describes plant-based meats as a potentially \"vital\" means to reduce the risks of diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and some cancers. Others have focused on reducing the climate impact of food production and \"the need to de-risk global food systems\" (Zane Swanson et al., 2023). The private and public sectors have taken note as well; in 2022, the \"plant-based meat, seafood, eggs, and dairy companies\" foods industry attracted at least $1.2 billion in private investment activity and at least $874 million in public funding (The Good Food Institute, 2022, pp. 55, 85\u201388).</p>\n<p>This enthusiasm has been propelled in some significant part by the informal hypothesis of price, taste, and convenience (henceforth, <em>PTC hypothesis</em>). Put succinctly by a leading non-profit in the space, the hypothesis proposes that plant-based meat \"can compete on the basis of price, taste, and convenience, and just remove animals from the equation altogether\" (Anderson, 2019). More specifically, the hypothesis first builds on the <em>PTC premise</em> that PTC are \"what dictates consumer choice for just about everybody\" (Anderson, 2019). Next, plant-based meats must have the same or better price, taste the same or better, and be as or more convenient compared to animal-based meat. According to the hypothesis, if plant-based meats were PTC-competitive to animal-based meats, then there would be no remaining reason for consumers not to abandon meat en masse.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-9acuYMGxSuirAoopt-2\" id=\"fnref-9acuYMGxSuirAoopt-2\">[2]</a></sup> Thus, just as cars replaced horses drawing carriages (Friedrich, 2020) and electricity replaced the slaughter of whales for oil used in lamps (Shapiro, 2018), it is supposed that plant-based meat would replace animal-based meat.</p>\n<p>The PTC hypothesis has become pervasive in the discourse on plant-based meats, spreading beyond its origin within the farmed animal advocacy movement. As an informal hypothesis, the exact components are often modified, sometimes adding health or nutrition, subtracting convenience, or distinguishing between taste and texture. Major banks have weighed in, with Barclays declaring \"taste and price will ultimately dictate whether or not alternative meat gains widespread acceptance\" (Theurer et al., 2019, p. 3) and ING Group claiming \"future growth\" will depend on \"the price gap,\" \"better taste and nutritional profile,\" and \"increase[d] distribution and availability\" (Geijer, 2020). Boston Consulting Group advises companies to \"improve taste, texture, and price\" and \"remove perceived barriers (such as feeling that alternative meat products are difficult to cook)\" (von Koeller et al., 2023). Similarly, other researchers and non-profits reiterate the view that consumer behavior around plant-based meats is primarily driven by PTC (Bryant, 2022; McHugh, 2022; ProVeg, n.d.). Finally, the popular press has adopted PTC as the key factors in analyzing plant-based meat (Graham, 2023; Splitter, 2020). In total, it is clear that PTC have been elevated as the key determinants of the impact of plant-based meat.</p>\n<p>While the PTC hypothesis is widespread, it has received little scientific scrutiny. We fill this gap here by aiming to evaluate whether a large majority of present-day consumers would be expected to switch from animal- to plant-based meat if it were PTC-competitive. In doing so, we necessarily discuss possible operationalizations of PTC and evaluate the premise that PTC are the main determinants of food choice. In parallel, we review the nascent empirical literature addressing the effects of each factor individually before reviewing studies that test all three factors in conjunction. Important limitations of the reviewed literature will also be discussed before concluding with an overall assessment of the PTC hypothesis and recommendations.</p>\n<h1>The PTC premise</h1>\n<p>Before examining the PTC hypothesis in full, we will examine the evidence supporting the key motivating premise that PTC are the primary determinants of food choice. Of course, there is no dispute that PTC are <em>important</em> factors in people's food choices, but research in food psychology demonstrates these are not the sole or primary factors. Intuitively, this fact is apparent when considering basic consumer behavior: any given grocery store likely offers thousands of cheap, tasty, and convenient products, and yet, consumers decide to purchase only some of these products, without gathering any information on the large majority of them. Presumably, consumers do so by relying on factors well beyond PTC. Indeed, the psychological literature has identified myriad influences of food choice spanning psychological, biological, physiological, situational, and socio-cultural factors in addition to product characteristics (K\u00f6ster, 2009). Furthermore, a rich literature on the psychology of meat consumption has identified factors particular to the consumption of meat and animal products. For example, people feel a peculiar personal attachment to meat (Gra\u00e7a et al., 2015), believe that meat is necessary for health, feel that meat consumption is socially normative, and perceive meat as a nice and natural component of a healthy diet (Piazza et al., 2015).</p>\n<p>Indeed, the notion that PTC are the primary causes of food choice does not arise from the academic literature but seems to have been popularized in a paper by a non-profit promoting the PTC hypothesis, which argues \"[t]he three foundational motivations for food choice are taste, cost, and convenience\" (Szejda et al., 2020, p. 5). The report reviews three studies to support the primacy of PTC. However, none of these studies finds PTC to be the top three factors in determining food choice. All are cross-sectional surveys of adults in the United States (US) and ask participants to rate the impact or importance of four to seven factors on their food purchasing decisions. Rankings were then determined based on the average of the responses. The first study was conducted in 1998 and found, in descending order of importance: taste, cost, nutrition, convenience, and weight control (Glanz et al., 1998, p. 1122). The second survey was administered annually from 2007 to 2010 and found, in descending order of importance: taste, nutrition, cost, and ease of preparation (convenience) (Aggarwal et al., 2016, p. 14). Finally, the third survey was performed annually from 2012 to 2019 and consistently found, in descending order of impact: taste, price, healthfulness, convenience, and environmental sustainability (<em>2019 Food &amp; Health Survey</em>, 2019, p. 12). In 2019, the same survey added two additional factors: \"your trust in the brand,\" which ranked second below taste, and \"recognizing the ingredients that go into the product,\" which ranked fourth after price (<em>2019 Food &amp; Health Survey</em>, 2019, p. 13). While these three surveys are the most frequently cited in support of the PTC hypothesis, there are others; however, they generally share the same methodological limitations.</p>\n<p>First, as the authors of the original report acknowledge, these surveys are \"best-suited for understanding attitudes rather than for perfectly predicting behavior,\" and future research should \"focus on studies of actual behavior rather than self-reported behavior\" (Szejda et al., 2020, pp. 7, 11). Thus, critically, the rankings in these studies reflect what people <em>perceive</em> as the most important factors rather than what would <em>actually</em> cause them to change their diets. Second, the cited studies were designed primarily to investigate the role of a few particular factors in food choice rather than to identify the most important factors. For example, one abstract indicates the study's objective is \"to examine the self-reported importance of taste, nutrition, cost, convenience, and weight control on personal dietary choices\" (Glanz et al., 1998, p. 1118). This explains why the studies examine only a handful of factors rather than the myriad influences of food choice. Third is a relatively minor issue, but these studies analyze the average ranking of each factor rather than how individual consumers rank the factors. Interpreting these averages as the preferences of individuals invokes the ecological fallacy: even if PTC were the most important factors on average, this does not imply that individual participants would each rank PTC as most important. In summary, there is little compelling evidence to nominate PTC as the primary causes or drivers of food choice.</p>\n<p>Producing compelling evidence to substantiate just the premise of the PTC hypothesis would require an ambitious experimental effort. Before addressing each of the above three methodological issues, the hypothesis would need to be properly operationalized. The aforementioned surveys leave the meaning of PTC open to interpretation. For example, respondents might interpret convenience to mean either \"easy to prepare\" or \"readily available.\" Taste might capture a wide array of concepts from flavor to texture or, in a different sense, personal aesthetic preference. Therefore, each factor must be carefully operationalized into specific empirical measurements. Next, to strongly support the hypothesis, factors must be tested experimentally rather than relying on merely asking people to report what they find most important since these self-reports are likely unreliable. To identify the <em>most</em> important determinants of food choice, it is necessary to contrast the many different potential causes and their combinations: appearance, odor, health, sustainability, social norms, familiarity, food safety, religion, and so on. Finally, there is the challenge of defining the \"most important\" set of factors for any given consumer, which becomes more difficult when testing numerous factors. For example, for some consumers, an allergy or religious belief might dominate all other factors in their food choices. Of course, this varies by food: allergies are quite important in choices about peanut products but less relevant for black beans. Which set of factors are reasonably deemed most important then depends on both the individual and the product in question.</p>\n<h1>Operationalizing and testing PTC individually</h1>\n<p>Given the lack of experiments systematically testing PTC in general as determinants of food choice, we will instead initially focus on each factor individually. In the context of choosing between plant- and animal-based meat, we will operationalize and review empirical evidence in turn for each factor. While this approach does not directly test the PTC hypothesis, which requires that competitiveness be obtained for all three factors in conjunction, it allows a larger body of evidence to be adduced. Furthermore, it seems reasonable to posit that a marginal improvement in any one factor, thus approaching but not necessarily obtaining PTC-competitiveness, might still result in some of the hypothesized reduction in animal-based meat usage.</p>\n<h2>Price</h2>\n<p>Price is the most clearly defined component of the PTC hypothesis, referring to the differential in retail prices for a pair of animal- and plant-based meats. Price might also seem to have the most straightforward case in its favor: decreases in plant-based meat prices presumably lead to more sales and, ultimately, less animal-based meat sales. However, this hypothesis is not guaranteed. For example, a lower price may lead some consumers to treat plant-based meats as inferior goods\u2014or cheap substitutes\u2014rather than a better deal. This effect might contribute to the lower popularity of margarine, which was designed as a substitute for butter at the time of its development in the 1880s (Dupr\u00e9, 1999). Alternatively, consumers simply may not treat the two products as substitutes. Whatever the reason, the extent of price substitution behavior can be measured via cross-price elasticity of demand estimates emerging in the economics literature. Our research has reviewed estimates of cross-price elasticities between margarine and butter (Mendez et al., 2023) and plant-based and dairy milk (Mendez &amp; Peacock, 2021). The results suggest that behavior might be inconsistent across studies. Many estimates suggest that decreased margarine or plant-based milk prices result in <em>increased</em> consumption of the corresponding animal product (known as complementarity, the opposite of substitution). While the studies we reviewed had important methodological limitations, this evidence casts doubt on the general notion of price substitution between plant-based analog products and their animal-based counterparts.</p>\n<p>The two existing cross-price elasticity studies of plant-based meat sold in US grocery stores are consistently inconsistent. (A third study is forthcoming (Hirsch, 2022).) Zhao et al. (2022) found that plant-based meat (75% of which was the beef-like Impossible and Beyond Meat brands) acts as a complement for beef (cross-price elasticity <span class=\"mjpage\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"-0.003\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mo\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.298em;

Meanwhile, Tonsor &amp; Bina (2023) found basically the opposite, with plant-based meat acting as a substitute for beef (0.01) and pork (0.11) but a complement for chicken (<span class=\"mjpage\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"-0.04\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mo\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.298em; padding-bottom: 0.446em;\">\u2212</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mn\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;\">0.04</span></span></span></span></span></span>), with all but beef reaching statistical significance at the 5% level. The two studies are not perfectly comparable and have certain methodological limitations, but they do agree that any effects of changes in plant-based meat prices seem to have only very small effects on animal-based meat sales. Note that some earlier estimates of plant-based meat cross-price elasticities use different study designs and analyses that constrain cross-price elasticities to substitution (examples reviewed in Lusk et al. (2022) Supplementary Table 5). Since study designs like discrete choice experiments are often analyzed so as to assume products are substitutes (Caputo &amp; Scarpa, 2022, p. 82), estimates from these studies should not then be taken as evidence against complementarity. While new methods relax this assumption, the results are again inconsistent, finding substitution for the Beyond Burger with beef and chicken but complementarity for the Impossible Burger (Tonsor et al., 2022, Table 7). Thus, while price is well-defined, its role in helping plant-based meats displace animal-based meats is not.</p>\n<h2>Taste</h2>\n<p>Taste here means the gustatory perception of flavor via the tongue and mouth rather than the aesthetic or preferential meaning of the word. While further operationalization of taste competitiveness is not usually explicated, product pairs meeting the criteria are described as \"the exact same product\" and \"indistinguishable\" (McKenzie, 2022). This description has been understood to mean the products will pass a blinded taste test of some sort (Stevens, 2021). For example, one classic design would give each blinded taster a sample of plant- and animal-based meat and ask them to correctly classify which was which. If half or less of the participants can classify them correctly, the test is passed, and the products are equivalent! However, this operationalization does not capture the idea of tasting the same <em>or better</em>; the results only show whether or not the two products were indistinguishable. Further note that this operationalization includes assumptions about other characteristics of the products besides taste: the products must also have identical texture, smell, shape, etc., to pass. These characteristics fall outside most people's conception of \"taste\" and thus are not likely captured by the survey evidence intended to support the PTC premise.</p>\n<p>However, more importantly, blind taste tests may lack external validity, as, outside an experimental setting, plant-based meat consumers will never be blinded. Instead, consumers will be informed of what it is they are eating, as is necessitated by food labeling laws, allergies, dietary restrictions, and ethical norms. Informed taste tests further probe the question of how to operationalize the concept of \"taste competitiveness,\" as one can no longer meaningfully use participants' ability to classify plant- and animal-based meats as an outcome measure. Instead, one might ask how similar an animal and plant-based product taste, which product tastes better, or to rate each product's taste on a Likert scale.</p>\n<p>Regardless of how exactly taste is operationalized, for these distinctions to matter, blind and informed taste test results must substantively differ. Indeed, this possibility is generally recognized (Garber et al., 2003) as taste is understood to be determined only partly by the <em>contents</em> of food; consumer psychology, context, and environment are also important causes of taste perception (Krishna &amp; Elder, 2021). Research on plant-based meats so far has not focused specifically on contrasting taste perception in blinded and informed conditions. However, the available evidence generally finds modest but meaningful effects on related measures of consumer acceptance, although some studies are small and potentially underpowered.</p>\n<p>In Sogari et al. (2023), 175 American consumers were randomized to blind and informed conditions, tasted four burgers (Beyond Burger, called \"pea protein\"; Impossible Burger, called \"animal-like protein\"; \"hybrid meat-mushroom\" burger; and \"100% beef\" burger), and then ranked their preference for each burger. Informing participants of the burgers' identities (for example, \"pea protein burger\") caused a statistically significant drop in the Beyond Burger's rank from third to fourth most liked, while the Impossible Burger remained first. In Caputo et al. (2022), 86 American consumers were randomized to blind and informed conditions, tasted four burgers (Beyond, Impossible, hybrid meat-mushroom, and 100% beef burger), and then participated in an experiment to measure willingness-to-pay for the burgers. Differences in willingness-to-pay between conditions did not reach significance given the small sample size; however, the point estimates suggest information caused willingness-to-pay to <em>increase</em> for the Impossible Burger by $0.91 and <em>decrease</em> for the Beyond Burger by $0.22 and the beef burger by $0.77. In Martin et al. (2021), 102 French consumers sampled both an animal- and plant-based sausage, first blinded and then with packaging information, and marked the strength of their preference on a scale ranging from animal-based (<span class=\"mjpage\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"-10\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mo\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.298em; padding-bottom: 0.446em;\">\u2212</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mn\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;\">10</span></span></span></span></span></span>) to plant-based (<span class=\"mjpage\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"10\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mn\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;\">10</span></span></span></span></span></span>).

Finally, in Schouteten et al. (2016), 53 consumers sampled both an animal- and plant-based burger, first blinded and then with packaging information. In contrast to the previous results, a meaningful effect of information was not detected, with average overall liking on a 9-point scale increasing by 0.2 from 4.7 for a plant-based burger and increasing by 0.2 from 6.5 for an animal-based burger. Note that this plant-based burger was slightly disliked, and the confidence intervals for these effects would be wide.</p>\n<p>Given these results, even plant- and animal-based meats which are indistinguishable in a blind taste test might still be experienced differently in an informed test. While the idea that plant-based meats must pass a blind taste test to be taste-competitive is intuitively appealing, informed tests have the benefit of reflecting consumers' naturalistic experience of purchasing plant-based meats. However, ultimately determining which approach identifies plant-based meats that are most effective in displacing animal-based meat is an empirical question largely lacking direct evidence. What evidence we do have suggests that tasting identical to meat may be less important than posited by the PTC hypothesis. Michel et al. (2021) surveyed 1,039 German consumers on whether \"meat alternatives should taste identical to meat (0) or not at all like meat (100).\" The mean response of 46 and standard deviation of 33 suggests a large degree of ambivalence, although this self-report should be regarded critically. A study of 93 Dutch meat consumers found wide differences in participants' perception of plant-based meat's similarity to animal-based meats but found little resulting association with subsequent liking of dishes incorporating that plant-based meat (Elzerman et al., 2011, p. 239). This is, to some extent, good news: perhaps plant-based meats may not need to perfectly emulate animal-based meat in order to compete, but only to be tasty in their own right.</p>\n<h2>Convenience</h2>\n<p>Convenience tends to be the least elaborated factor and has been discussed less in recent years. It is also the broadest in its possible interpretations, potentially applying to every step of obtaining and consuming food. Convenience might be considered in two parts: availability and functionality. Competitive availability would then entail plant-based meat needing to be available everywhere animal-based meat is sold. Furthermore, purchase must be as or more convenient; for example, products must be available on the same menu or in the same part of the store (rather than a separate menu or aisle). Competitive functionality might include as or more functional packaging, similar (or lower) levels of perishability, and preparation that requires the same or less effort and time. Plant-based meat might need to be as or more functionally flexible in forming different end products, like how beef can be used whole or ground. Finally, convenience might be interpreted as individuals' knowledge and skills for obtaining and preparing plant-based meat.</p>\n<p>Unlike price or taste, the availability component of convenience is not an attribute of the product itself but its ubiquity and physical surroundings. Thus, while scenarios invoking competitiveness on price and taste require only imagining a superior product, convenience-competitiveness could require an effective doubling of the animal-based meat supply chain. Of course, ideally, the displacement of animal-based meat would lessen the burden, but this nonetheless could represent a much larger change to the world than price or taste competitiveness. Given the breadth of feasible operationalizations of convenience, no empirical work has probed convenience-competitiveness generally. Some work has focused on availability within grocery stores, moving plant-based meats to the (animal-based) meat aisle from devoted 'vegan' aisles. A non-randomized study of 108 grocery stores found the move increased sales of plant-based meat but did not decrease sales of animal-based meat (Piernas et al., 2021). Another smaller non-randomized study of nine stores found a very small increase in plant-based meat sales and no evidence of an effect on animal-based meat sales (Vandenbroele et al., 2019). In summary, there is a lack of clarity on what exactly constitutes convenience equivalence, and what little evidence might be relevant does not find a meaningful impact of increased convenience on animal-based meat usage.</p>\n<h1>Empirical tests of the PTC hypothesis</h1>\n<p>Thus far, neither a strong motivation for the premise that PTC largely determine food choice nor evidence in favor of the impact of PTC individually have been found. However, this is not sufficient to reject the PTC hypothesis, which holds that if plant-based meat is PTC-competitive with animal-based meat, the large majority of current consumers will shift from animal- to plant-based. To test the PTC hypothesis directly, we will focus narrowly on studies where participants choose between an animal-based meat and a putatively PTC-competitive plant-based meat. This approach aims to test the implication of the PTC hypothesis that closely similar plant- and animal-based meats will serve as substitutes.</p>\n<p>However, it is crucial to note that these narrow outcome measurements focused only on the choice between target products do not accurately capture the impact of plant-based meats. A counterfactual scenario must be considered to understand the full impact of plant-based meats: what would have happened in the absence of a plant-based meat? For example, suppose a study found that 25% of consumers order a plant-based rather than animal-based burger. A naive interpretation of this result is that the availability of a plant-based burger causes a 25% reduction in animal-based burgers. However, the result could, in fact, represent no effect at all if, given the option, those consumers would not have purchased an animal-based burger anyway. Instead, they may have chosen a different plant-based meal or purchased nothing at all. We will revisit this issue later to illustrate how it can significantly alter estimates of impact.</p>\n<h2>Hypothetical discrete choice experiments</h2>\n<p>Hypothetical discrete choice experiments (HDCEs) provide some relatively weak tests of the PTC hypothesis. HDCEs generally ask consumers to imagine hypothetically picking a plant- or animal-based burger from a menu. The menu usually includes randomly selected prices, which are then analyzed to produce estimates of selection rates when prices are equal. Participants are often told that the burgers taste the same or similar, and they are presented as if they are prepared and ready to eat. Thus, at least in a hypothetical setting, these studies obtain PTC-competitiveness.</p>\n<p>One such study offered US consumers two plant-based, one animal-based, and one cultivated meat (labeled \"lab-grown\") burger. The results suggested that about 19% of consumers might purchase an equally priced plant-based or cultivated meat burger instead of an animal-based burger, with 10% making no purchase (Van Loo et al., 2020, fig. 3A).<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-9acuYMGxSuirAoopt-3\" id=\"fnref-9acuYMGxSuirAoopt-3\">[3]</a></sup> An otherwise identical version of the experiment provided respondents with assurances that the \"plant-based burger patty [...] mimics the taste of an animal meat burger\" and information about the production process of the different burgers (Van Loo et al., 2020, fig. 2). Together, this information increased purchases of plant-based or cultivated meat to 27%, with 8% making no purchase (Van Loo et al., 2020, fig. 3A). A second study indicated that \"all burgers taste the same\" and found that 70% of a Canadian sample would purchase the beef burger, 25% the plant-based burger, and 5% would make no purchase when prices were equal (Slade, 2018, Table 5). However, when asked, only 8% of respondents believed all the burgers would taste the same. The author notes that \"to some extent, this is representative of the actual choice environment\u2014even if burgers did taste equivalent, many consumers may not believe this to be the case\" (Slade, 2018, p. 431). A third study compared a \"Beef Burger\" and \"Beyond Meat Burger\" without any indication of taste equivalence. At equal price, 22% of US grocery shoppers (excluding participants who would opt to buy neither) would select the Beyond Burger (Tonsor et al., 2021, fig. 20; Tonsor et al., 2022, p. 5). A fourth study compared \"plant-based meat-like burgers\" and conventional hamburgers at equal prices after providing participants with information about both, including that the plant-based meat was \"very meat-like in terms of texture, color and taste\" (Carlsson et al., 2022, p. 24). Only 11% of Swedish hamburger consumers selected the plant-based meat option (Carlsson et al., 2022, Table 2).</p>\n<p>Although not precisely an HDCE, a series of surveys asked a similar question: whether participants preferred \"real meat from animals\" or \"meat-like alternatives made from plants,\" without reference to specific products or the option not to purchase (Miller, 2021). Conducted in June 2020 across 27 countries, 27,000 meat-eating participants were told to assume plant-based meat and animal-based meat \"tasted equally good, had equal nutritional value and cost the same.\" 41% of the total sample preferred plant-based meat; a slight majority (51\u201355%) in five of the countries preferred plant-based meat, 63% in Mexico, and 66% in Vietnam. However, the design of this study likely increases these estimates: the addition of \"equal nutritional value\" likely increases the attractiveness of the plant-based meat; the environmental framing and questions used earlier in the survey might increase social desirability bias; using a text description rather than pictures of the possible items and broad non-specific question wording might elicit more hypothetical bias; and participants are forced to choose one or the other of animal-based meat or plant-based meat. That said, the study included only self-identified meat eaters, which would generally push the estimates towards animal-based meats, as might excluding assurances of competitive convenience. Indeed, estimates from Miller (2021) tended to be higher than estimates from other studies (Figure 1), although the comparisons are imperfect. For example, Carlsson et al. (2022) found 11% of Swedes preferred plant-based meat, while Miller (2021) found 45%. In summary, the results of HDCEs conflict with the hypothesis that consumers largely prefer PTC-competitive plant-based meats over animal-based meat.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/iukeBPYNhKcddfFki/pzbhp08ui3g8f7luzrwc\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Figure 1: Percentage of participants choosing plant-based meat instead of animal-based meat during either an HDCE (denoted \"H\") or a commercial case study (\"C\").

(2020) study with additional information. ***Average across 27 countries.</p>\n<h2>Commercial case studies</h2>\n<p>Of course, the results of HDCEs may not translate to actual behavior. Hypothetical choice and self-reports of diet change likely tend to exaggerate the extent of meat reduction: one comparison found that in a hypothetical choice, 59% of meals selected were meat-free, while in actuality, sales data found only 36% of meals to be meat-free (Brachem et al., 2019, p. 22). For data on actual behavior, we can look at the introduction of plant-based meats in commercial contexts, although price details are not always available. Furthermore, unlike the previous HDCEs, which often rely on representative samples of the population, these commercial case studies necessarily include only customers who self-selected to make a purchase at that particular restaurant. Thus, these estimates may still be somewhat optimistic.</p>\n<p>To start, the home-goods-retailer-cum-cafeteria Ikea sells plant-based hotdogs that are equally or lower-priced, readily available alongside animal-based hot dogs, and \"received a 95 percent approval rating\" in taste testing in Sweden (Webber, 2019). In September 2019, Ikea's plant-based hot dogs composed about 8% of annual hot dog sales globally (Southey, 2019).<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-9acuYMGxSuirAoopt-4\" id=\"fnref-9acuYMGxSuirAoopt-4\">[4]</a></sup> Similarly, a sample of 350 locations of the fast-food chain Burger King indicates that Impossible Burgers represent about 15% of total burger sales,<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-9acuYMGxSuirAoopt-5\" id=\"fnref-9acuYMGxSuirAoopt-5\">[5]</a></sup> and the sales of beef burgers \"had not fallen as a result\" (Mehta &amp; Balu, 2019). However, the Impossible Burger was generally slightly more expensive and may sometimes take longer to prepare than the beef burger, which could be especially important to fast food customers. In terms of taste, Sogari et al. (2023) found the Impossible Burger's mean preference ranking in a blind taste test was not statistically significantly different than a beef burger (2.1 vs 2.5, respectively, indicating both burgers ranked around second on average). That said, the beef burger may have been significantly less salty than the Impossible Burger, potentially lowering the bar for taste equivalence. Another blind taste test found that the Impossible burger patty had a similar average liking score to a beef burger (<em>Chicken and Burger Alternatives</em>, 2018).<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-9acuYMGxSuirAoopt-6\" id=\"fnref-9acuYMGxSuirAoopt-6\">[6]</a></sup> Moreover, complete meals containing plant-based meats tend to be somewhat better liked than plant-based meats on their own (Hoek et al., 2012, Table 6; Qammar et al., 2010, p. 554), although this trend may not be universal (Elzerman et al., 2011, fig. 2). As such, taste competitiveness or near competitiveness is likely a reasonable assumption about prepared Impossible burgers but does remain an unanswered empirical question. As a final example, the burger restaurant chain Umami Burger introduced the Impossible Burger in 2018; in the six weeks following, it represented ~20% of burger sales (Cameron &amp; O'Neill, 2019, fig. 17). These case studies again suggest that most consumers do not prefer plant-based meats, even for relatively PTC-competitive products.</p>\n<h2>Malan 2022 field experiment</h2>\n<p>The strongest evidence of actual behavioral impacts of PTC-equivalent plant-based meats likely comes from a study introducing Impossible Foods' plant-based ground beef to a University of California Los Angeles dining hall (Malan et al., 2022). Impossible ground beef was introduced at two stations in the dining hall. On Thursdays, students had the option of receiving prepared burritos with either Impossible ground beef, animal-based cubed steak, or veggies, while the build-your-own entree line offered Impossible ground beef every day alongside animal-based cubed steak, shredded beef and other animal products.</p>\n<p>In this study, price is almost always equivalent since students pay for dining hall access for the entire semester, not individual meals; a negligible proportion of meals were purchased with other means of payment. With regards to taste, Impossible ground beef is not directly comparable to either the cubed steak or shredded beef served in the study, nor has it been subjected to any public taste tests comparing it with ground beef. However, as reviewed above, the Impossible Burger, which is made of similar ingredients, has been found to taste equivalent to ground beef burgers in some studies. Furthermore, Malan (2020) includes a survey on taste perceptions of 215 participants at the intervention site, although some of the question phrasing might evoke slight agreement or social desirability bias, and the survey may be affected by selection bias. Of the 96 surveyed participants who self-selected to try the Impossible ground beef, 86% agreed or somewhat agreed it was delicious; 85% that Impossible ground beef \"is a satisfying alternative to animal meat\" (Malan, 2020, Table 20); and 71% choose to eat it more than once (Malan, 2020, p. 189). Of the 89 open-ended responses describing what was liked about the Impossible ground beef, 52% mentioned the flavor, feel or texture and 30% its similarity to animal-based meat (Malan, 2020, Table 27). Conversely, of the 49 open-ended responses on what was disliked, 29% mentioned the flavor or feel and 24% the texture (Malan, 2020, Table 28). Given these results it may be reasonable to conclude the Impossible ground beef was fairly well-liked among those participants who consumed it, although it is not equivalent to the other beef products offered. Finally, convenience is likely equivalent since all meals are prepared for students by dining hall staff.</p>\n<p>The study measured how many beef-containing meals were distributed at the intervention dining hall, where the Impossible ground beef was available, as well as distribution at two other dining halls as controls, which we refer to as A and B. For all dining halls, data on how many meals of each type were served was available before and after the intervention. Dining halls were not randomized to intervention and control status, and participants were known to cross over between dining halls (Malan et al., 2022, p. 226), both factors that could bias effects in either direction. Control dining hall A was adjacent to the intervention dining hall, and some intervention materials were thus visible (Malan, 2020, p. 119), while control dining hall B was isolated from the intervention. In addition to making plant-based meat available, the study employed several co-interventions designed to reduce meat consumption (Malan, 2020). These included environmental education, low carbon footprint labels on menus, and an advertising campaign to promote the new product, all of which have some evidence demonstrating their effectiveness (Bianchi, Dorsel, et al., 2018, p. 11; Brunner et al., 2018; Jalil et al., 2019; Osman &amp; Thornton, 2019). Thus, the study's results cannot be entirely attributed to the addition of plant-based meat options to the intervention dining hall's menu.</p>\n<p>To begin, we focus only on the burrito station of the intervention dining hall. In the ten weeks after adding the Impossible burrito to the intervention dining hall's menu, 26% of burrito purchasers chose the Impossible, 7% the veggie, and the remaining 67% the steak burrito (Malan, 2020, Table 12). Consistent with previous results, in a scenario that ensures price, convenience, and potentially taste competitiveness, the portion of consumers selecting the plant-based meat option remains modest.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/iukeBPYNhKcddfFki/aelwgnh3f6spcxhs1xig\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Figure 2: Percentage of each burrito type selected before and after intervention.</p>\n<p>The before and after, as well as control, data available in this study also demonstrate crucial shortcomings in the HDCEs and commercial case studies: they do not compare against a counterfactual where plant-based meat is unavailable. Thus, it is unclear what would have happened otherwise, which is crucial for understanding the causal effect of plant-based meat on animal-based meat usage. One approach to estimate the outcome of such a counterfactual scenario is to use the before-intervention data in Figure 2, which shows the veggie burrito comprises 15% of selections in the absence of the Impossible burrito. With the Impossible burrito available, this share declines to 7%, suggesting the Impossible burrito partially replaced the demand for veggie burritos rather than animal-based beef. Thus while 26% of burritos distributed were Impossible burritos, using the before-intervention data suggests only a 19 percentage point decline in steak burritos.</p>\n<p>The control dining halls in the study provide a more rigorous approach to estimating a counterfactual than the before and after analysis. However, to make the control and intervention dining halls comparable, we must expand our focus to all Impossible ground beef meals, not just burritos. Since Impossible ground beef is designed to be a substitute for animal-based beef, we expand our analysis to all animal-based beef meals (rather than just steak burritos) but exclude impacts on other meats like poultry or pork. For comparison's sake, we can repeat the analysis in Figure 2 using this new outcome measure (Figure 3). As before, we first consider a naive analysis that assumes every Impossible ground beef entree displaced an animal-based beef entree. Since 11.4% of entrees in the intervention dining hall were Impossible ground beef, we would assert an 11.4 percentage point reduction in beef entrees. Next, we look at actual beef demand before and after adding Impossible ground beef to the intervention dining hall and find a much smaller decline of 3.3 percentage points.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/iukeBPYNhKcddfFki/llo4kz7ktquftdgtbobc\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Figure 3: Six different analytic approaches to calculating the effect of adding Impossible ground beef to the menu, among other interventions, on demand for beef entrees. Supporting data and calculations are available at <a href=\"https://osf.io/5cqem/\">https://osf.io/5cqem/</a>.</p>\n<p>To compare the intervention and control dining halls, we will compute a difference in differences. That is, we will first compute changes in the proportion of beef entrees distributed before and after intervention in each dining hall. Second, we take the difference of the before-and-after changes between the intervention and control dining halls.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-9acuYMGxSuirAoopt-7\" id=\"fnref-9acuYMGxSuirAoopt-7\">[7]</a></sup> When comparing the intervention dining hall against control dining hall A\u2014where the percentage of beef entrees actually <em>increased</em>\u2014the effect of Impossible ground beef looks somewhat better, resulting in a 4.0 percentage point decrease in beef entrees. Conversely, beef demand went down in control dining hall B, so the estimated effect of Impossible ground beef looks somewhat smaller at 2.1 percentage points. Lastly, comparison to both control sites combined yields an effect in between the others, a 3.2 percentage point decline. While these are small numbers, the <em>relative</em> effect of different approaches to estimating a counterfactual is large, which underscores the importance of appropriately measuring what would have happened otherwise.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, this variation in the control dining halls is surprising: after all, in the absence of intervention, we might expect no change. In this case, the prominent launch of Impossible ground beef at the intervention dining hall may have affected which of the three dining halls the students chose. Looking at the change in the number of entrees distributed at each dining hall suggests one possible story of spillover. Control dining hall A, which was adjacent to the intervention dining hall, saw a 12,432 entree decline in overall meals distributed, a 2.4 percentage point decline in demand for other vegetarian options (besides Impossible ground beef), and a 0.7 percentage point increase in beef entree demand. Meanwhile, the intervention dining hall saw a 16,529 meal increase. Together this points to the possibility that the intervention, in fact, concentrated students likely to eat Impossible ground beef at the intervention dining hall while encouraging beef-eating students to go next door, without having much effect on total consumption. Control dining hall B, which was further away, also saw an 8,775 entree decline in the overall number of meals distributed. However, this control saw a small increase (1.1 percentage points) in demand for other vegetarian options and a small decrease (1.2) in beef demand, opposite of the changes at control dining hall A.</p>\n<p>One way to account for this potential spillover of students between intervention and control is to simply ignore the distinction between intervention and control sites. Instead, the study sites can be combined in a single before and after analysis. This yields a very small change in beef entree selection, only 0.3 percentage points, compared to a 5.0 percentage point increase in Impossible ground beef entree selection. There was also a 2.6 percentage point decline in other vegetarian selections. This analysis supports the idea that introducing Impossible ground beef may have primarily attracted students already willing to eat vegetarian entrees from other dining halls. While Malan (2020) is not straightforward to interpret, it illustrates the importance of making comparisons to counterfactual scenarios and demonstrates that only a small share of consumers might prefer PTC-competitive plant-based meat.</p>\n<h2>Further caveats</h2>\n<p>In reflecting on the evidence considered here\u2014from commercial case studies to controlled experiments\u2014we should consider several caveats that may make these early estimates of the impact of plant-based meats overly optimistic. First, all the eateries in these studies ultimately choose to provide plant-based meats and are thus potentially subject to selection bias in favor of eateries with customers likely to enjoy plant-based meats. For example, Malan et al. (2022) was conducted with college students, who are usually under the age of 35, and at the University of California, Los Angeles in the western US, both demographics which are more likely than average to select plant-based meats in HDCEs (Tonsor et al., 2022, Table 1). Second, many, if not most, of the reviewed studies likely included numerous and sometimes extensive additional co-interventions also designed to increase sales of plant-based meat and/or decrease sales of animal-based meat, like promotions, ad campaigns, and environmental information. These will presumably reduce in intensity over time, as might their effects.</p>\n<p>Third, these early studies may represent novelty effects and tap into consumers' curiosity to try something new. One survey identified \"I like to try new foods\" and \"I've been hearing a lot about them and was curious\" as the two most popular factors in a self-report of why customers tried plant-based meats (<em>A Consumer Survey on Plant Alternatives to Animal Meat</em>, 2020, p. 5). This effect would also be expected to fade over time. Indeed, this decline may already have been observed. In 2019, sales of the Beyond Taco at the fast-food chain Del Taco declined from 6% to 4% of the sales mix (Maze, 2019), and across two samples of Burger King stores, sales of the Impossible Burger declined from 30 per day per store to 20, and from 32 to 28, in the weeks following introduction (Shanker &amp; Patton, 2020).</p>\n<p>Fourth, effects could be reduced by spillover, where an intervention has an impact outside the expected context. Plant-based meats may affect the consumption of animal products besides the one they are intended to emulate or affect subsequent food choices. Mechanistically, spillover can occur in individuals or institutions. For example, moral licensing could occur, with an individual consumer's virtuous plant-based eating at lunch resulting in feeling entitled to indulge in more meat for dinner. A lack of satiation could also lead to spillover: an unsatisfying plant-based meal might leave the consumer craving animal products. Positive spillover could also occur, with a tasty plant-based meal inspiring further plant-based consumption. As an example of institutional spillover, a university dining hall might add a plant-based burger to the menu on Mondays but simply serve animal-based burgers on Tuesdays and displace another vegetarian option.</p>\n<p>However, the extent to which spillover occurs is an empirical question. One study of the cross-price elasticity of plant-based meats already suggests spillover. In Zhao et al. (2022), at least 75% of the plant-based meat in the study was beef-like, but the study found unexpected complementarity for beef and substitution for chicken instead. Another study measured spillover effects of increasing the availability of vegetarian options at lunch on consumption at the subsequent dinner. There was little evidence for spillover, but the estimate was relatively uncertain (Garnett et al., 2019, Supplementary Table S21).<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-9acuYMGxSuirAoopt-8\" id=\"fnref-9acuYMGxSuirAoopt-8\">[8]</a></sup> Detecting spillover effects requires comprehensive measurement of relevant outcomes; in this case, animal product usage both at the time and location of intervention, but also usage afterward and elsewhere. Without such careful measurements, the size and direction of spillover effects, and thus the total impact of plant-based meats, will remain uncertain.</p>\n<p>Fifth, the body of research reviewed here is subject to publication bias, whereby we are likely more aware of results perceived as positive rather than negative. For example, companies are less likely to highlight failed product launches, and academics are less likely to publish results that do not find an effect. Sixth, the body of literature largely lacked pre-registration and analysis plans and thus is vulnerable to reporting bias, where authors selectively report favorable results. That said, for some studies, it's unclear which direction would be \"favorable.\" For example, some authors were funded by the animal agriculture industry, and an incentive could conceivably exist to either exaggerate or minimize the impact of plant-based meats. In any event, there was no direct evidence of reporting or publication bias. In total, these six caveats suggest the reviewed studies might be optimistic yet.</p>\n<h1>Conclusions &amp; recommendations</h1>\n<p>Collectively, these results show that the PTC hypothesis, in its current form, is likely false. The underlying premise of PTC as the key determinants of food choice is not supported by evidence from cross-sectional surveys on consumers' self-reported determinants. The little available evidence thus far suggests PTC do not individually significantly reduce animal-based meat usage. HDCEs find that a minority of consumers select PTC-competitive plant-based meats instead of animal-based meats. (Miller (2021) adduces two countries where plant-based meat selection nears two-thirds when health equivalence is also assured. However, the study design is especially subject to hypothetical and social desirability biases and likely yields estimates that unrealistically favor plant-based meats.) Data from introducing plant-based meats at particular restaurants suggests that they draw only a modest portion of customers. Finally, a controlled experiment introducing high-quality plant-based meat to a dining hall\u2014at almost always equal price and convenience to animal-based meat\u2014shows that most participants did not choose plant-based meat. Across five lines of evidence, it is clear that the empirical evidence opposes the PTC hypothesis.</p>\n<p>This result does not imply that plant-based meats have no role in animal, environmental or public health advocacy. Instead, new, evidence-based theories of change about the role of plant-based meats must be advanced and rigorously evaluated rather than simply assuming that creating and selling PTC-competitive plant-based meats will result in the widespread displacement of animal-based meat. Important alternatives to the PTC hypothesis might consider the role of future consumers rather than present-day consumers, who have been the focus of this paper. Future consumers might experience a large change in social norms or otherwise shift their preferences toward consuming plant-based rather than animal-based meats. This is a common feature of many animal advocacy theories of change (Delon et al., 2022), and advocates will potentially find it difficult to shift social norms in favor of plant-based meat.</p>\n<p>Next, a more expansive notion of taste should be considered rather than a narrow focus on developing products that taste identical to animal-based meat. Of course, plant-based meats need to taste <em>good</em> to gain consumer acceptance, but there is little evidence that tasting identical to animal-based meat is essential. Furthermore, meat is not a monolith but a wide target with diverse taste profiles. This provides an opportunity to produce plant-based meat that tastes as \"good as <em>a</em> meat\" rather than \"the same as meat.\" Generally, more taste tests of plant-based meats would be beneficial. Given the $7.8 billion in investments in plant-based food companies (The Good Food Institute, 2023, p. 55) and calls for further large-scale government research and development funding (Friedrich &amp; Purvis, 2022), additional funding might reach diminishing marginal returns in improving taste. Without appropriate baseline taste tests, it will be impossible to determine if improvements were realized.</p>\n<p>Given the scale and breadth of investment\u2014spanning non-profits; for-profits; and, increasingly, governments\u2014the sparsity of research evaluating the effectiveness of plant-based meats in serving their stated goal of reducing animal-based meat usage is notable. While this review focused only on work relevant to the PTC hypothesis, recent systematic reviews reveal only a handful of additional studies testing the effect of plant-based meats on animal-based meat usage (Bianchi, Garnett, et al., 2018; Grundy et al., 2022; Taufik et al., 2019). Few resources are currently devoted to the scientific testing of <em>any</em> theories of change involving plant-based meats, let alone the PTC hypothesis. What research exists has not been a focus of discussion among advocates. It is crucial, then, that future research empirically evaluates the effects of plant-based meats on the displacement of animal-based meat and compares these effects with those of other interventions to reduce animal-based meat usage. Furthermore, advocates must engage with this work and adjust their strategies accordingly. Ultimately, advocates and researchers must develop and test alternatives to the PTC hypothesis rather than adhere to a status quo that is contradicted by the evidence.</p>\n<p><em>This paper is a project of <a href=\"https://rethinkpriorities.org/\">Rethink Priorities</a>\u2014a think tank dedicated to informing decisions made by high-impact organizations and funders across various cause areas.

Briefly, this updates and corrects the text to indicate that a negligible portion of participants did pay for meals; an animal-based ground beef equivalent to the Impossible ground beef was not served; and dining hall staff served all food. Furthermore, it adds information on a survey of participants' perception of the taste of Impossible ground beef. The paragraph previously read:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In this study, price is entirely equivalent since students pay for dining hall access for the entire semester, not individual meals. With regards to taste, Impossible ground beef specifically has not been subjected to any public taste tests. However, as reviewed above, the Impossible Burger, which is made of similar ingredients, has been found to taste equivalent in some studies. <em>The study does not describe exactly the form of the beef in the steak burrito, making its taste equivalence less certain but probably still a reasonable inference. For the ground beef served on the build-your-own entree line, taste equivalence seems very likely. We can further surmise that the Impossible ground beef meals in the study were at least desirable:</em> a follow-up survey found that 71% of purchasers were repeat purchasers (Malan, 2020, p. 189). Convenience is likely equivalent as well since the burritos are prepared for students by dining hall staff, <em>and the build-your-own entree line is self-serve for both animal- and plant-based ground beef.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It now reads:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In this study, price is almost always equivalent since students pay for dining hall access for the entire semester, not individual meals; <em>a negligible proportion of meals were purchased with other means of payment</em>. With regards to taste, Impossible ground beef <em>is not directly comparable to either the cubed steak or shredded beef served in the study, nor has it</em> been subjected to any public taste tests <em>comparing it with ground beef</em>. However, as reviewed above, the Impossible Burger, which is made of similar ingredients, has been found to taste equivalent to ground beef burgers in some studies. <em>Furthermore, Malan (2020) includes a survey on taste perceptions of 215 participants at the intervention site, although some of the question phrasing might evoke slight agreement or social desirability bias, and the survey may be affected by selection bias. Of the 96 surveyed participants who self-selected to try the Impossible ground beef, 86% agreed or somewhat agreed it was delicious; 85% that Impossible ground beef \"is a satisfying alternative to animal meat\" (Malan, 2020, Table 20);</em> and 71% choose to eat it more than once (Malan, 2020, p. 189). <em>Of the 89 open-ended responses describing what was liked about the Impossible ground beef, 52% mentioned the flavor, feel or texture and 30% its similarity to animal-based meat (Malan, 2020, Table 27). Conversely, of the 49 open-ended responses on what was disliked, 29% mentioned the flavor or feel and 24% the texture (Malan, 2020, Table 28). Given these results it may be reasonable to conclude the Impossible ground beef was fairly well-liked among those participants who consumed it, although it is not equivalent to the other beef products offered.</em> Finally, convenience is likely equivalent since <em>all meals</em> are prepared for students by dining hall staff.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Replace \"Dining halls were not randomized to intervention and control status, and participants were free to cross over between dining halls during the study, both factors that could bias effects in either direction.

We may not be thinking about convenience but convenience is going to be a central factor. [...] We want to actually create plant-based alternatives and clean meat alternatives to conventional animal agriculture that compete on the basis of those factors and shift the world away from industrialized animal agriculture\"(Cargill &amp; Wiblin, 2018). \"Despite rising awareness of the global impacts of our dietary choices, consumers continue to base their purchasing decisions primarily on price, taste, and convenience. Quite simply, reducing animal protein consumption is intractable for most people due to a lack of appetizing and affordable products that could serve as alternatives to conventional animal protein products. The challenge, then, is to innovate and bring to market diverse protein alternatives that are as delicious, price-competitive, and convenient as animal-derived food products are currently. By making healthy and sustainable alternative proteins comparable to conventional proteins in the areas of flavor, price, and ubiquity, alternative proteins become the default choice\" (<em>GFI Research Program</em>, 2019, pp. 4\u20135).

This is a particularly critical question during the current period of high inflation and increased interest rates that are together squeezing government budgets. Every dollar spent on climate action is a dollar not spent on education, health, welfare programs, and a host of other areas which have an immediate impact.</p><p>Cost benefit analysis is a common modern tool which gets applied to deliver a supposedly objective answer to this question by weighing up the cost of climate action against the expected costs if climate change is not addressed.</p><p>In this article I\u2019m going to argue that:</p><p>(1) the dollar value of climate impacts are going to be underestimated for the foreseeable future.</p><p>(2) reducing climate impacts to a dollar value renders some kinds of harm invisible, hiding critical moral and political questions about what we value.</p><p>(3) directly prioritising carbon reduction measures based on cost and supporting as many as necessary to reach explicit targets is likely to be much more effective.</p><p>(4) a carbon tax is only one part of the required policy mix to drive climate action.</p><p><strong>Why is this interesting?</strong> I think that (1) probably isn\u2019t surprising in the abstract but I still found the details of how much is missing from SCC estimates to be remarkably large. (2) is an example of a more general problem of how quantification can render invisible anything that does not get quantified - I think this should be generally interesting to EAs. (3) presents an alternative to the SCC which I hadn\u2019t heard of before I wrote this article. (4) presents some of the latest evidence about when carbon taxes are effective and situations where other policies are a much better idea - these are details which I\u2019d also never come across so clearly before writing this article.</p><h3><strong>(1) Underestimating The Costs Of Climate Change</strong></h3><p>The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.carbonbrief.org/qa-social-cost-carbon/\"><u>Social Cost of Carbon (SCC)</u></a> is an estimate of the financial cost of each extra tonne of CO2 which is emitted into the atmosphere based on the harms that this CO2 will cause.</p><p>This simple statement hides the fact that computing a SCC value involves predicting the cost of changes to a huge number of different complex global and regional systems over the next several decades as the Earth moves into a climatic range which has never before been observed by humanity. We can only model these impacts and have very little ability to validate the predictions and rarely have the ability to account for compounding impacts across areas. Areas where we can\u2019t model the impact are usually treated as areas that have zero impact and so the overall SCC estimate is usually very conservative.</p><p>One of the most recent attempts to compute an updated SCC in a government policy context was the US Environment Protection Agency (EPA) who published a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/system/files/documents/2022-11/epa_scghg_report_draft_0.pdf\"><u>137 page pdf</u></a> considering the latest state of SCC research as of September 2022. All the way down on page 79 of the PDF is this incredible summary table which shows which kinds of damage have been accounted for by the SCC estimates produced in the report:<br>&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/ht7tHYpLNX3ChhX4X/qlonbjonxxcc2phovzkt\"></p><p>For example, there\u2019s no accounting for clearly important areas like temperature extremes or variability, or indeed changes to precipitation (rainfall), impact of coastal storms, or even displacement and migration from all of this.</p><p>Based only on the kinds of damage modelled so far, the EPA\u2019s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.eenews.net/articles/epa-floats-sharply-increased-social-cost-of-carbon/\"><u>proposed</u></a> conservative 2030 SCC is $140 (2.5% discount rate), $230 (2% discount rate), $380 (1.5% discount rate) (all in 2020 $). However, in their own words from their report:</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cThe modeling implemented in this report reflects conservative methodological choices, and, given both these choices and the numerous categories of damages that are not currently quantified and other model limitations, the resulting SC-GHG estimates likely underestimate the marginal damages from GHG pollution.\u201d</i></p></blockquote><h3><strong>(2) Hidden Moral And Political Choices</strong></h3><p>Estimating the SCC sounds superficially like an important step in working out how much money should be spent on climate action. However, any SCC estimate will necessarily obscure a large number of moral and political choices that deserve to be considered more directly. I\u2019ll consider three examples here.</p><p>Climate change will increase the frequency of extreme heatwaves. In July 2023 Phoenix, Arizona experienced a record breaking&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jul/31/us-extereme-heat-alert-wildfires\"><u>31 days</u></a> of &gt;110F (&gt;43.3C) temperatures. These conditions can be partially adapted to by the use of air conditioning but what\u2019s the right dollar price to put on this intervention? Is it the price of the air conditioning units plus the electricity it takes to run them? Should a price be put on the lived experience of sheltering indoors in air conditioned rooms day after day from daytime temperatures, or having to be continuously vigilant to avoid&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2023/07/13/phoenix-heat-wave-conditions/\"><u>contact burns</u></a> when you do venture outside?</p><p>Some companies are responding by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/25/fan-jacket-japan-innovation-keeps-workers-cool-in-heat\"><u>designing jackets which have built in fans</u></a> to help people to be able to go outside on very hot summer days. If these jackets can be made cheaply enough does that mean that higher temperature days are okay? What value should be placed on the loss of being able to go outside on a hot summer day without a fan jacket?</p><p>Climate change is pushing areas of Earth into extended droughts that are resulting in crop failures and large numbers of climate refugees. For example in 2023&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/apr/27/human-driven-climate-crisis-fuelling-horn-of-africa-drought-study\"><u>the current drought in the Horn of Africa</u></a> has resulted in &gt;4 million people in need of humanitarian assistance, and at least 180,000 refugees. What price should be placed on this tragedy? Is it the cost of the humanitarian aid being provided to enable the affected people to survive? Or is there a higher price which should be placed on the collective displacement and suffering that is being&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.worldweatherattribution.org/human-induced-climate-change-increased-drought-severity-in-southern-horn-of-africa/\"><u>directly caused by climate change</u></a>?</p><p>Coral reefs are iconic sites of rich natural beauty that host more than a quarter of all marine fish species, and also directly support over 500 million people worldwide, who rely on them for daily subsistence, mostly in poor countries. In 2018 the IPCC predicted that 99% of coral reefs would be lost if the world warmed by 2C. A&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2022/02/coral-reefs-extinct-global-warming-new-study\"><u>new study in 2022</u></a> which used a higher resolution model predicted that 99% of coral reefs may be lost much sooner when we reach only 1.5C of warming.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"https://www.coast.noaa.gov/states/fast-facts/coral-reefs.html\"><u>Attempts have been made</u></a> to put a price tag on the value of coral reefs by looking at different factors such as fishing, tourism, and coastal protection. These estimates tend to be at least tens of billions of dollars per year of value. However, this again raises the question of whether any price would actually be appropriate for these rich and unique concentrations of biodiversity.</p><p>One way of addressing these issues would be to reject the requirement to reduce all the benefits down to a single dollar value which obscures that different kinds of value are being mixed together and where types of value which are hard to put a dollar price on are rendered invisible. The alternative would be to embrace a collection of measurements of the value of climate action. For example the single social cost of carbon could be replaced by an estimate of the multiple types of costs seen at a particular temperature e.g. limiting the temperature increase to 1.5C might result in $XB of financial impacts, as well as producing expected cumulative heatwave days of Y days, an expected drought area of Z km^2, and destroying A% of coral reefs.</p><p>Estimating these figures would still remain very difficult, and the choice of which measures to include would be politically contentious, but this would at least make visible some of the choices which are currently hidden while also embracing a much richer definition of harm that doesn\u2019t have to filter harms through a financial lens that is likely to alter what is counted as important.</p><p>The philosopher C. Thi Nguyen gave a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/live/zt03qjTyefU?feature=share&amp;t=1543\"><u>talk in 2022 titled \u2018Value Collapse\u2019</u></a> which discussed the idea that quantitative values actively make it harder to notice what gets excluded by those values. For example cost benefit analysis often end up excluding non-economic values which are then rendered invisible and of zero value. This concept should be of general interest to the Effective Altruist community as there is presumably a risk that quantitative estimates of the good done by different organisations risks rendering invisible any types of benefit which are not captured by the chosen measurement.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/xWFhD6uQuZehrDKeY/capitalism-power-and-epistemology-a-critique-of-ea\"><u>Capitalism, power and epistemology: a critique of EA</u></a> is an example of a critique of EA itself that is based on the idea that the way EA approaches quantification through a capitalist lens will shape the interventions which EA supports.</p><h3><strong>(3) A Target-Consistent Approach</strong></h3><p>The SCC is likely to be underestimated for many years to come and this implies that the costs which governments will be willing to bear will be lower than if we were actually able to fully predict the future costs of climate change.</p><p>Another key problem with a SCC based approach to determining the level of climate action is that it doesn\u2019t directly attempt to meet specific temperature targets. This means that a SCC (and indeed any carbon tax policy where the price is determined based on anything other than a target outcome temperature) risks giving the impression of political action without actually achieving the required speed of emissions reductions needed to limit warming to a specific temperature (e.g. 1.5C).</p><p>A better approach is to take as a starting point the existing international targets which countries have already signed up to - net zero by 2050 with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement\"><u>the Paris goal</u></a> to hold \u201cthe increase in the global average temperature to well below 2\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels\u201d and pursue efforts \u201cto limit the temperature increase to 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels.\u201d</p><p>The \u201ctarget-consistent approach\u201d uses a Marginal Abatement Cost (MAC) curve to set the required carbon price. This completely skips the difficult problem of computing the SCC and instead focuses on the simpler (but still complex) question of estimating the cost and potential scale of available carbon reduction interventions required to hit a particular target.</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/ht7tHYpLNX3ChhX4X/sptukxzltw7jvhd2tpho\"></p><p>(Illustrative MAC curve - the height of each bar is the \u00a3/tCO2e of each intervention, and the width represents the scale of the available intervention. A* is the point where the cumulative emissions savings of interventions adds up to the emissions savings required to meet the target at the lowest possible price.)</p><p>The UK moved to this \u201ctarget-consistent approach\u201d in 2009 and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/valuing-greenhouse-gas-emissions-in-policy-appraisal/valuation-of-greenhouse-gas-emissions-for-policy-appraisal-and-evaluation\"><u>in September 2021</u></a> released an updated carbon price based on this methodology, along with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1017060/carbon-values-lit-review.pdf\"><u>a really interesting literature review</u></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>MACs are not a silver bullet as there are still difficult issues to consider including things like dependencies between different interventions and changes to cost as the scale of deployment of an intervention changes.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.edf.org/sites/default/files/documents/MACC_2.0%20report_Evolved_EDF.pdf\"><u>\u201cMarginal Abatement Cost Curves for U.S. Net-Zero Energy Systems\u201d (2021)</u></a> is an example of a report which attempts to address some of these issues.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/valuing-greenhouse-gas-emissions-in-policy-appraisal/valuation-of-greenhouse-gas-emissions-for-policy-appraisal-and-evaluation\"><u>The UK\u2019s 2030 carbon value</u></a> computed using a target-consistent approach is \u00a3280 (in 2020\u00a3). \u201cTo capture the full range of uncertainty, a plus or minus 50% sensitivity range has been deemed appropriate around the central series.\u201d which gives a range of \u00a3140 - \u00a3420.&nbsp;</p><p>(\u00a3140, \u00a3280, \u00a3420) = ($182, $364, $546) using $1.3 to \u00a31, compared to the EPA\u2019s 2020 proposal of a 2030 SCC of $140 (2.5% discount rate), $230 (2% discount rate), $380 (1.5% discount rate). Using a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://data.oecd.org/conversion/purchasing-power-parities-ppp.htm\"><u>2022 PPP exchange rate</u></a> of $1.47 = \u00a31, this gives (\u00a3140, \u00a3280, \u00a3420) = ($206, $411.6, $617.4). This shows that the current EPA 2030 SCC estimate is within the PPP adjusted bounds of the UK\u2019s \u201ctarget-consistent approach\u201d carbon value. However, it\u2019s worth noting that the SCC approach has previously resulted in much lower values - in the US the 2030 SCC was first estimated to be&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2016-12/documents/scc_tsd_2010.pdf\"><u>$50 (2007 $) in 2010</u></a>. The Trump administration in 2017 announced a new SCC of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://yaleclimateconnections.org/2020/07/trump-epa-vastly-underestimating-the-cost-of-carbon-dioxide-pollution-to-society-new-research-finds/\"><u>less than $10</u></a> based on a dramatically more conservative definition of the SCC.</p><p>Another interesting perspective is that climate action has become rapidly more affordable. This paragraph takes the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theccc.org.uk/publication/net-zero-the-uks-contribution-to-stopping-global-warming/\"><u>history of UK action as an example</u></a>. In 2003 the UK targeted a 60% reduction in CO2 emissions by 2050 and expected this to cost 0.5 - 2.0% of GDP in 2050. In 2008 the target was increased to an 80% reduction and the costs were still expected to be only 1-2% of GDP in 2050. In 2019 the target was increased to a 100% reduction with the same expected costs. In 2020 the expected net costs were&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theccc.org.uk/publication/sixth-carbon-budget/\"><u>estimated to have dropped</u></a> to below 1% of GDP every year through to 2050. In 2021 the UK\u2019s Office For Budget Responsibility (OBR)&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.lse.ac.uk/granthaminstitute/news/costs-and-benefits-of-the-uk-reaching-net-zero-emissions-by-2050-the-evidence/\"><u>estimated</u></a> that climate investment costs will likely be fully repaid by 2070. The OBR calculations did not include the benefits from avoided climate change impacts or other co-benefits.</p><p>Of course, agreeing the right carbon price for policy analysis is only the first step of the solution. As of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theccc.org.uk/publication/2023-progress-report-to-parliament/\"><u>June 2023</u></a> the UK government is not on track to actually deliver on its committed climate goals.</p><h3><strong>(4) Climate Policy: Beyond A Carbon Tax</strong></h3><p>One of the central policies which has been promoted for addressing climate change is a carbon tax. This is presented as a politically neutral way of pricing in the externality of carbon pollution and in theory drive decarbonisation.</p><p>The trouble is that it\u2019s very politically challenging to introduce such a far reaching new tax, particularly at a price high enough to actually drive changes, and without causing regressive impacts.&nbsp;</p><p>As of 2023,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://carbonpricingdashboard.worldbank.org/\"><u>23% of global emissions</u></a> are covered by some kind of carbon tax system, and according to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://wires.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/wcc.681\"><u>one study</u></a>:</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cWe conclude that the effectiveness of carbon pricing in stimulating innovation and zero-carbon investment remains a theoretical argument. So far, there is no empirical evidence of its effectiveness in promoting the technological change necessary for full decarbonization.\u201d</i></p></blockquote><p>Of course, you should&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/s/BQBqPowfxjvoee8jw/p/ythFNoiAotjvuEGkg\"><u>Beware The Man Of One Study</u></a>, and indeed there\u2019s a direct rebuttal in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10640-021-00594-6\"><u>another paper</u></a> which concludes:</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cA recent review study by Lilliestam, Patt and Bersalli (2021) of the impact of carbon pricing on low-carbon innovation and deep carbonization concludes that there is no evidence for such an impact. We evaluate this study and identify various shortcomings of it, which together cast strong doubts on its main conclusion. Instead, we conclude, based on the studies reviewed by the authors and additional, overlooked literature, that carbon pricing has had a small but positive and significant effect on low-carbon innovation.\u201d</i></p></blockquote><p>A&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2542435118305671\"><u>2018 paper</u></a> provides some really tangible examples of why carbon pricing is not a panacea.</p><p>Directly subsidising a new technology can be much cheaper than taxing an existing very widely deployed technology:</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cWhen Germany started supporting photovoltaics (PV), for example, the price differential between PV and coal was roughly US$0.50/kWh, and has since declined to essentially zero as a result of the learning triggered by the global PV expansion. Covering a large initial price differential with targeted technology support was feasible, because the initial volume of capital stock to which that support applied was so low; the total volume of financial support was still trivial in relation to the overall economy. A carbon price, by contrast, covers the price differential by penalizing the old technology, for which the capital stock starts high and then declines. Covering the $0.50/kWh price differential for PV would have required an initial carbon price of roughly $700 per ton of CO<sub>2</sub>, applied to fossil-based generators that then supplied more than 90% of the power market, and possibly to other sectors such as steel and cement. This would have crippled German industry and dramatically raised consumer prices. It was, rightly, a political non-starter.\u201d</i></p></blockquote><p>Planning and delivering changes to overall systems is critical to accommodate new technology:</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cThe second barrier is a mismatch between the new technology and the existing infrastructure. For example, it has been possible to generate small amounts of fluctuating PV and wind power without threatening the stability of power transmission and distribution grids. Today, about 15% of the European electricity supply is fluctuating PV and wind power, and it is becoming apparent that major elements of the grid, from transformer stations to long-distance transmission lines, will need to be upgraded or replaced. We will also need new infrastructures, such as large-scale electricity storage. Unless we adapt the infrastructure, the problems will only grow. Infrastructure development takes coordinated planning and development based on long-term strategic priorities, and this is not something that carbon prices directly address.\u201d</i></p></blockquote><p>Institutions and markets may need to be reformed:</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cThe third barrier is institutional. One example is to be found in the rules determining wholesale power prices. Wind power and PV generation respond to the weather rather than to price signals. Under current power market designs, growing shares of wind power and PV have pushed down wholesale power prices, in some cases well below zero, precisely during their times of peak production. This reduces profits for fossil generation, but even more so for wind and solar themselves. Carbon prices do not directly address this problem, whereas market reforms can.\u201d</i></p></blockquote><p>I found a great 2021&nbsp;<a href=\"https://strathprints.strath.ac.uk/77103/1/Stoll_Mehling_ERSS_2021_Climate_change_and_carbon_pricing_overcoming_three.pdf\"><u>discussion paper</u></a> which reviews the controversy around carbon prices. This paper proposes a hybrid of three different approaches:</p><blockquote><p>(1)&nbsp;<i>\u201cEspecially in the middle of the marginal abatement cost curve, carbon pricing may induce emission reductions, for instance by triggering fuel-switching in the power sector. The efficiency of carbon pricing to achieve emission reductions at the margin through process optimization has been amply demonstrated. Assuming a certain degree of rationality and market functioning, carbon pricing initiatives focus mitigation efforts on activities with the lowest abatement cost, and are therefore an important element in any climate policy portfolio to drive emissions reductions cost-effectively in the near term.\u201d</i></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>(2)&nbsp;<i>\u201cBehavioral economics provides a theoretical explanation of barriers to energy efficiency, which are difficult to address with carbon pricing. On the left side of the marginal abatement cost curve, where financial incentives tend to be ineffective, information policies such as labelling and command-and-control policies such as performance standards, phase-outs, or outright bans tend to be more effective. Bans of inefficient light bulbs are a poster example. Pricing mechanisms can provide incentives, but will not prevent people from engaging in certain conducts.\u201d</i></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>(3)&nbsp;<i>\u201cPublic choice theory explains challenges faced in making collective decisions, which, in turn, have vital consequences for policy making to foster innovation. In particular, at the right side of the marginal abatement cost curve, technologies can be found which require large investments and long-term horizons. It is important to identify such areas which actually require complementary policies in order to avoid supporting dead-end technologies while precluding valuable alternatives that are either unknown to policy-makers, or underappreciated in their mitigation potential. Directed policies sacrifice the availability of those technology options which are not favoured by support policies, whereas carbon pricing creates a technology-neutral incentive for all mitigation options.\u201d</i></p></blockquote><p>There are many examples of these non-carbon tax policies, for example:</p><ul><li>Type (2) - Phasing out sale of Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) cars, some countries in 2030, and many others by 2040 (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase-out_of_fossil_fuel_vehicles\"><u>source</u></a>)</li><li>Type (3) - $94BN for Clean Energy Technology Demonstrations, announced in Sept 2022 (<a href=\"https://www.energy.gov/articles/united-states-announces-94-billion-global-public-funding-accelerate-clean-energy-worldwide\"><u>source</u></a>)</li></ul><p>The hardest part of introducing a carbon price is that it increases the price of existing products. This is extremely unpopular and has lead to things like the street riots led by the \u2018Yellow Vests\u2019 movement in France in late 2018.</p><p>The alternative approach is to rely on technology innovation and learning curves to drive down the price of green options to the point where switching technology is cheaper without subsidies. The term \u201cgreen premium\u201d was&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.gatesnotes.com/Introducing-the-Green-Premiums\"><u>coined in 2020</u></a> to refer to the difference in price between the green option and the conventional option.</p><p>We\u2019re already seeing the green premium being eliminated in some key areas of the energy transition such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theecoexperts.co.uk/blog/is-renewable-energy-cheaper-than-fossil-fuels\"><u>electricity generation</u></a>: in 2021, IRENA reported that two-thirds of newly installed renewable power in G20 countries had lower costs than the cheapest fossil fuel-fired option. This is resulting in important developments such as India&nbsp;<a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/india-coal-pause-plan-climate-renewables-68b75402af663e4553434bc672fc9cda\"><u>deciding to halt consideration of any proposals for new coal plants for the next five years</u></a> and focus on growing its renewables sector instead.</p><p>The key observation about green premiums is that we can\u2019t be sure how quickly (if ever) innovation will eliminate these for all the required technologies in the energy transition. The IEA estimates that in 2023&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.iea.org/topics/tracking-clean-energy-progress\"><u>only three of more than fifty technology areas</u></a> are \u201con track\u201d in the energy transition. Hitting emissions reductions targets will likely involve transitioning to many technologies before their green premium has been eliminated. This will require governments to have the political will to find the money necessary to provide subsidies that (hopefully temporarily) cover the green premium, possibly through increased taxes or by cutting spending elsewhere, or regulations will have to be introduced to force consumers to buy the more expensive green options. The only other alternative is that emissions reductions will be delivered late and the world will warm more than we want it to.</p>", "user": {"username": "mchr3k"}}, {"_id": "jS6HPv4Qx9gWC98f5", "title": "EA Organization Updates: August 2023", "postedAt": "2023-08-14T20:55:19.946Z", "htmlBody": "<p>We\u2019re featuring some opportunities and job listings at the top of this post.

They'll initially work across our EU Tech Policy Fellowship and our Tarbell Fellowship. Within 3-6 months, we expect they'll transition to leading one of these programmes. We\u2019re excited to hire a seasoned operator that can steer one of these fellowships to success - or drive the launch of a third fellowship in an entirely new career path!</p><h2>Responsibilities and activities</h2><p>We expect the AI Programme Lead will assume the following key responsibilities:</p><ul><li><strong>Designing and delivering AI training programmes for early-career journalists and policymakers (~30%) </strong>This will likely be your primary work task for the first ~4 months (&gt;70% of your time). Thereafter, we expect it to occupy much less of your time (~20%).</li><li><strong>Taking extreme ownership of one of Training for Good\u2019s current programmes (30%). </strong>We expect that you will transition to leading one of our existing programmes within 3-6 months of joining Training for Good. Once this happens, it will become one of your primary responsibilities (&gt;60% of your time). You will be given a large degree of autonomy to enable you to thrive.</li><li><strong>Miscellaneous (40%).&nbsp;</strong>As a small team with a startup mentality, we expect our entire team to take responsibility for a wide range of tasks. A significant amount of your time will be occupied by tasks not explicitly listed here, some of which may be well beyond (or even below) your current skill level. You will not always be operating within your zone of excellence, and you need to be okay with that. We will work with you to prioritise additional responsibilities based on your \u201cskill\u201d and \u201cwill\u201d.</li></ul><h2>What we\u2019re looking for</h2><p>You might be an especially good fit if you have:</p><ul><li><strong>AI expertise</strong>: A background in AI governance, strategy or communications roles (eg. 3+ years though we\u2019re open to applicants with less experience than this). Successful candidates must be able to build introductory &amp; intermediate AI curricula for non-technical audiences and facilitate the training programme itself.</li><li><strong>Ability to work autonomously</strong>: An ability to excel with relatively little supervision almost immediately. We\u2019re excited to find a proactive self-starter to join our team.</li><li><strong>Excellent communication and collaboration skills</strong>: Exceptionally strong verbal and written communication skills for internal and external stakeholders. Ability to deliver effective training sessions to small groups on AI fundamentals.</li></ul><p>To apply for the AI Programme Lead role, please complete this <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdUNussE-nXT3AYqB9FxwfAOG_K8Uh_Sqzv3ncAojfIsijEQg/viewform?usp=send_form\">application form</a>.</p>", "user": {"username": "cilliancrosson@gmail.com"}}, {"_id": "mu4GHGpNMbdd5yL5R", "title": "\u3069\u3093\u306a\u672a\u6765\u304c\u5f85\u3061\u53d7\u3051\u3066\u3044\u308b\u306e\u304b\u3002\u306a\u305c\u3001\u6c17\u306b\u304b\u3051\u308b\u3079\u304d\u306a\u306e\u304b\u3002", "postedAt": "2023-08-14T14:08:44.789Z", "htmlBody": "<p><i>This is a Japanese translation of \u201c</i><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/a8myKSh4KWDmuj6BA/what-could-the-future-hold-and-why-care\"><i><strong>What could the future hold?

"<p><strong>Abstract:</strong></p><p>Are inspiration-based narratives effective in animal advocacy for transforming hearts and minds, and encouraging action towards better animal protection, consideration and care? This essay investigates various arguments in favor of, and against, inspiration within the EAA movement. We are hopeful that inspiration is effective, even if non-quantifiable; but many obstacles are still to be overcome, and further research must be conducted. For now, we should consider inspiration as an exploratory tool with potential. Our main premise is that inspiration can foster lasting change through the pursuit of inspired goals and incremental transformations. Ultimately, we believe that we should aim for a combination of approaches to engage in grassroots capacity-building to create a movement large enough to transform the system and individual attitudes within it (\u201cthe 3.5% threshold\u201d) (Chenoweth, Stephan &amp; Stephan, 2011).</p><p><strong>1) Introduction</strong></p><p>Do you consider yourself an animal advocate? If so, what was it that made you one? Or, more precisely, what inspired you to become an animal advocate? If I am asking this question, it is because I wish to address the role of inspiration \u2013 and inspiration-based narratives \u2013 in the shaping of our thinking, of our values and of our actions. As suggested by Kaufman, \u201cinspiration is best thought of as a surprising interaction between your current knowledge and the information you receive from the world\u201d (Kaufman, 2011). We have all heard stories and narratives \u2013 from leaders, advocates, organizations \u2013 that inspired us to rethink our attitudes and values, to reshape our behaviors and, sometimes, to become involved in a movement. Inspiration is \u201ca breathing in or infusion of some idea, purpose, etc. into the mind; the suggestion, awakening, or creation of some feeling or impulse, especially of an exalted kind\u201d (Thrash &amp; Elliot, 2003). It is all around us and it can take on many forms: we can be inspired by a person, a work of art, an idea and more,... Scholars working on the concept of inspiration even go so far as to claim that inspiration can enable individual as well as societal change (Oleynick, Thrash, LeFew, Moldovan &amp; Kieffaber, 2014).</p><p>Yet, inspiration within animal advocacy tends to be overlooked because it appears to be a non-quantifiable concept, the effects of which have no way of being determined. However, inspiration-based narratives and inspirational leaders are present within the movement of animal advocacy, and their discourse may have the power to impact many individuals, corporate groups, or governments to bring about change in the way they act towards animals. But what does it mean for inspiration to be effective in the context of animal advocacy, and how do we determine inspiration\u2019s effectiveness? Why do approaches to inspiration matter? And, if inspiration proves to be effective in this regard, and if it facilitates a paradigm shift towards better consideration of, and care for, animals, might it be more effective than other forms of advocacy, such as lobbying, campaigns, research, public education, or even litigation?</p><p>In this essay, we will explain how inspiration can be conceptualized, before looking at why this approach is called into doubt by some scholars. We will then argue that inspiration, despite its abstract quality, should be scrutinized in more depth, and that \u2013 if appropriate \u2013 it should be embedded in animal advocacy interventions. Our main argument is that inspiration is effective because it can foster lasting change through the pursuit of inspired goals and incremental transformations.</p><p>Before pursuing this postulate and attempting to build a case for the use of inspiration by animal advocates across all animal-related causes, we must specify that, for animal advocacy to be effective, (1) a holistic approach must be examined; furthermore, (2) a case-by-case approach is indispensable for understanding the underlying mechanisms of EAA. In fact, (1) inspiration is not the secret ingredient of a recipe for EAA, and many other elements must be scrutinized; moreover, (2) what might work for one leader, organization, or specific animal- related cause might not work for another leader, organization, or animal-related cause.</p><p>We shall first proceed to an examination of the concept of inspiration as an approach to EAA.</p><p><strong>2) Clarification, conceptualization and summary</strong></p><p>2.1) Setting the scene</p><p>Before we dive into this argument, we must clarify three things: where can inspiration be found; by whom it can be transmitted; and for whom?

For the sake of clarity, we will consider inspirational messages with the broad purpose of generating better animal protection, consideration and care, and we will not scrutinize animal causes/issues themselves in depth.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/39SBieN4csipWpkJh/uxvk93jmz0hpyexuawsz\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/39SBieN4csipWpkJh/n4mfad13d8bzxwzopqms 105w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/39SBieN4csipWpkJh/o3modesfxbinhhiy6hzo 185w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/39SBieN4csipWpkJh/sxygt9ei6bqsrkwmdx4d 265w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/39SBieN4csipWpkJh/rhvhv2clmjo8pewhatmm 345w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/39SBieN4csipWpkJh/u9yfayjefn7an3dbe6ay 425w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/39SBieN4csipWpkJh/bq1g8952ufrqtan2hkva 505w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/39SBieN4csipWpkJh/chj1z5rl9cvmazfeu9ob 585w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/39SBieN4csipWpkJh/ovmwnz8xasa1lpfng3om 665w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/39SBieN4csipWpkJh/lllx5iofwdafom87sixq 745w\"></figure><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/39SBieN4csipWpkJh/qsnabr7i5aqwy6k7g98r\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/39SBieN4csipWpkJh/fqhtzp82gtio5vr7ad5s 90w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/39SBieN4csipWpkJh/khyetj36vdlbjrqyy4lo 180w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/39SBieN4csipWpkJh/bthivec8cziyoyshmquf 270w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/39SBieN4csipWpkJh/lm9kutmyf6oxay9h5oxa 360w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/39SBieN4csipWpkJh/nmmmjzfailvhgzxxjjhh 450w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/39SBieN4csipWpkJh/lytq7zwdask7tm2gc4oo 540w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/39SBieN4csipWpkJh/xzwhoadmeiepuolzlnnb 630w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/39SBieN4csipWpkJh/qzwrhygyumtzbm1bksa3 720w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/39SBieN4csipWpkJh/m52geedrmliumnz5acwu 810w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/39SBieN4csipWpkJh/pxyuynjp0smcoddxuvpv 866w\"></figure><p>2.2) How is inspiration conceptualized?</p><p>Thrash and Elliot have conceptualized inspiration as a psychological construct (Thrash &amp; Elliot, 2003).

Inspiration in the context of EAA is of interest because it offers a non-coercive way of transforming attitudes and motivating action towards better animal protection, consideration and care. One of the many goals of animal advocates is to get people on board with our ideas (Leenaert, 2017), which could lead to action in favor of better animal protection, consideration and care. How can inspiration-based narratives help animal advocates in this respect?</p><p>2.3) How does inspiration foster lasting change in animal advocacy?</p><p>We postulate that inspiration can foster lasting change through the pursuit of inspired goals and incremental transformations in animal advocacy. Scholars have shown that inspiration facilitates the pursuit of goals (Milyavskaya, Ianakieva, Foxen-Craft, Colantuoni &amp; Koestner, 2012) (all else being equal). Highly inspired individuals display increased progress towards goals, and scholars explain this phenomenon by the fact that these individuals set inspired goals (Ibid). This suggests the creation of a virtuous cycle: the establishment of greater inspired goals allows greater goal pursuit. The achievement of these goals leads to new, greater goals and new, greater goal pursuit, and so on (see Figure 5). This finding is significant because many animal advocates call for lasting shifts and envisage long- term perspectives. Inspiration may present a reformist and moderate path (Francione &amp; Garner, 2010). , yet it can involve abolitionist and radical goals. To apply our argument in real conditions, we could envisage the achievement of one \u201csmall\u201d goal, such as the abolition of battery cages, to motivate an incremental increase in the scope of inspired goals, heading towards the abolition of factory farming. However, we err on the side of caution when applying this \u201cvirtuous cycle\u201d to animal advocacy, it being purely hypothetical. We acknowledge that, in practice, matters are more complex, and that animal advocates encounter many other obstacles.</p><p>Figure 5 shows the mechanism (blue box) binding together the passage from being inspired \u2018by\u2019 to being inspired \u2018to\u2019.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/39SBieN4csipWpkJh/lucgltlwr541dcvb1jtc\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/39SBieN4csipWpkJh/jbe1cxwkq3ah1ouewvts 125w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/39SBieN4csipWpkJh/f0zipnzrgulmmv6xrjh6 205w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/39SBieN4csipWpkJh/jafuzhkwzpmlfsxrefst 285w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/39SBieN4csipWpkJh/cjhdmevbtqsxhrpwhydy 365w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/39SBieN4csipWpkJh/gxrbmvdhtzmuhh9sxp8a 445w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/39SBieN4csipWpkJh/r7272lt3j99gqqfklxri 525w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/39SBieN4csipWpkJh/uw564joqg0v29y4jcnoy 605w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/39SBieN4csipWpkJh/pihfyk5xaqsheguio6gt 685w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/39SBieN4csipWpkJh/zbzd8y9t0pbktcwah1tj 765w\"></figure><p>We have explained how people are inspired to act towards better animal protection, consideration and care in response to an inspirational message. It is through the setting of inspired goals that individuals will enter a virtuous cycle, which fosters incremental and lasting transformation.</p><p><strong>3) Analysis</strong></p><p>In this section, we shall review some of the principal arguments that have been formulated against the use of inspiration in EAA, before looking at arguments that support the use of inspiration.</p><p><strong>3.1) Why are some sceptical about the use of inspiration in the context of EAA?</strong></p><p>3.1.1) \u201cInspiration and its effectiveness cannot be measured \u2013 if inspiration has long-term, diffused and indirect effects: why should we invest in an intractable concept?\u201d</p><p>When there is no, or sparse, evidence of the effectiveness of inspiration, some may not wish to invest in it \u2013 as Lewis Bollard explained when referring to certain advocacy tools (Bollard, 2017). What evidence is there that inspirational narratives are worth investing in? How can such narratives do the most good in the world? Inspiration is a broad and vague concept, and it can come about in various settings. Thus, how can we capture its effectiveness if it occurs outside of an advocacy intervention? Furthermore, a measurement of inspiration must be conducted through self-reports, because it is an inherently subjective experience. However, there is a limit to self-reported surveys (Peacock, 2018) and, in the case of inspiration, other alternatives to using self- reported surveys are yet to be determined. Besides the fundamental measurability issue, it would be difficult to measure inspiration systematically because individuals may not indicate the same period of time between the moment they are inspired \u2018by\u2019 and the moment they are inspired \u2018to\u2019. Accordingly, if inspiration is difficult to measure as a concept, how can we measure its effectiveness? This question remains unanswered. Yet, some measurement of effectiveness would be necessary for determining whether investing in this tool is valuable for EAA. Moreover, if we consider that we can measure inspiration and its effectiveness, it would be time- and labour-intensive to measure them within an advocacy intervention, even more so across several advocacy interventions.</p><p>3.1.2) \u201cWhat do inspiration-based narratives have to offer in comparison with other approaches?\u201d</p><p>We know that some approaches to advocacy are effective: lobbying; regulatory efforts; research and public education; non-violent campaigns (Chenoweth, Stephan &amp; Stephan, 2011); strategies using \u201cshock\u201d and sexism (Gaarder, 2011); litigation and even shaming to a certain extent (Jacquet, 2016). Inspiration-based narratives operate within the field of awareness-raising and, thus, they are overrated (Leenaert, 2017). Providing people with \u201cinspiring\u201d information will not encourage them to act, and the attitude-behavior (Ibid) gap will remain. Hence, what is the extra that inspiration brings to the EAA movement? Why should we be interested in expanding our advocacy tool-kit to yet another approach? And in particular with inspiration if we do not have accessible ways of determining whether it is effective or not. Given our generally limited resources and time, some argue that we should focus on EAA approaches that we know to work (Sebo, 2019).</p><p>3.1.3) \u201cIsn\u2019t inspiration manipulation?\u201d</p><p>There is a fine line between inspiration and manipulation. Both strategies are close, and manipulation is also used through aspirational messages and promises to influence behavior (Sinek, 2009). As explained by Leenaert, the vegan movement is mainly based on moral arguments (Leenaert, 2017), and these arguments often appeal to our emotions. Hence, it can be easy furtively to coerce people into believing one argument or the other. How do we know that an inspirational leader is not manipulating us? How can trust be developed between inspirational leaders and their audience if these leaders present the same arguments as those presented by manipulators?</p><p>3.1.4) \u201cWe should focus on systemic change rather than individual change\u201d</p><p>If we wish to change the lives of individuals, we should address systemic structures because it is through them that lasting change will operate (Gabriel, 2017). However, inspirational narratives, despite the fact, in some cases, of targeting large audiences, are oriented towards individuals. An inspirational leader may not have the same influence on one individual or the other. Ultimately, if an inspirational leader has some impact on a person, but that person does not have the power to operate within a system, the inspiration is \u2018lost\u2019. For example, let us imagine that an inspirational leader makes a speech in a conference room before government representatives about incorporating vegan options into school cafeterias nationwide. This leader inspires a \u2018minor\u2019 government official; however, major government representatives are not impressed. If we consider that major government representatives and large multinationals are the ones able to impact the system; and that inspirational interventions are ineffective in their respect; the intervention will have no impact on the system or induce change.</p><p>Now that we have explored various arguments against the use of inspiration in EAA, we will dive into arguments that support the use of inspiration.</p><p><strong>3.2) Why does inspiration matter?</strong></p><p>3.2.1) \u201cInspiration can be measured\u201d</p><p>Thrash and Elliot developed an \u201cInspiration Scale\u201d (IS) (Thrash &amp; Elliot, 2003) and it measures inspiration in various situations. Measuring inspiration is complex; it comes with many biases that must be examined extensively if we wish to find ways of overcoming them. Despite those barriers, and as suggested by Muller, some elements of reality can be ignored if we are absorbed by the metrics (Muller, 2019). The fact that inspiration is a non-quantifiable and unfathomable concept does not make it an uninteresting or unimportant aspect of EAA. For the time being, we can explore the IS in greater depth, and expect to develop a more systematic, and less time- and labour- consuming way of measuring effectiveness within, and outside of, advocacy interventions.</p><p>3.2.2) \u201cInspiration is effective when combined with other EAA approaches\u201d</p><p>Inspiration is necessary but not sufficient (Dess &amp; Picken, 2000).We do not claim that inspiration is more effective than other approaches. Instead, we claim that inspiration may enhance the overall impact of advocacy interventions thanks to its spontaneous nature, as well as the change, the engagement and motivation that it can induce. However, we must note that this is an empirical question to which we do not have the answer. Inspiration can be found in many advocacy interventions. Public education may feature narratives that inspire an audience to rethink their attitudes and transform their behaviors. With respect to litigation, an attorney may deliver an inspiring speech that shifts the way a jury sees a case. In the context of EAA, facts rarely change hearts and minds (Leenaert, 2017), and we need something else to achieve this. Inspiration can turn the tide of an overall intervention because it proposes moral shifts without using guilt-driven discourse. Even if shaming is effective under certain conditions (Jacquet, 2016), it employs a degree of coercion \u2013 which is something inspiration strives to break free from. We are not arguing that shaming is not an effective approach, or that inspiration is more effective. They are two different approaches, and to choose one or the other is something that must be determined case-by-case.</p><p>If the goal is effectiveness, if it applies to a specific case, one can choose to apply inspiration through paths that have been proven to be effective in EAA. In this way, one can see the short- term effectiveness of an initial intervention (i.e. public education in schools,...), and imagine that it can be sustained through inspiration in the longer term \u2013 considering that inspired people display a sustained pursuit of goals (Milyavskaya, Ianakieva, Foxen-Craft, Colantuoni &amp; Koestner, 2012). Moreover, inspiration enhances an individual\u2019s well-being (Thrash, Elliot, Maruskin &amp; Cassidy, 2010), hence EAA that inspires more people is a way of augmenting happiness and reducing suffering for humans, but also for animals!</p><p>3.2.3) \u201cInspiration matters because it is not forced on you\u201d</p><p>As mentioned in the summary, two core characteristics of inspiration are \u201cevocation\u201d and \u201ctranscendence\u201d. Inspiration is not forced upon individuals. Individuals happen to be inspired by external stimuli; and are later inspired \u201cto\u201d act in response. However, it should be noted that inspiration-based narratives may not galvanize every individual to change. Subjective sensitivity about a topic depends on many factors. Hence, some individuals might be more inclined to change their behaviors and attitudes if they are inspired to do so; when others are more likely to alter their behaviors and attitudes when they are forced to do so. For instance, some will stop eating meat if they read a book, or if they listen to a podcast about meat eating; whilst others will stop if we make meat less accessible through an increase in prices (Leenaert, 2017). Altogether, we should aim for a variety of approaches to EAA, if we wish to see change at numerous levels.</p><p>3.2.4) \u201cInspiration matters because it may induce lasting and sustainable systemic change\u201d</p><p>Individuals form collectives. There is power in what an individual can do to change policies or consumers\u2019 choices; and the sum of individual actions can make a difference (MacAskill, 2016). Inspiration- based narratives offer pointers towards better animal protection, consideration and care. Such inspiration can have its effects on an individual or systemic basis, depending on the targeted audience. If an inspirational leader inspires members of a company, the company might push towards better consideration of animals in their plan of action. If an individual is inspired by a narrative, s/he might want to take part in the movement. Either way, transformation occurs. Two examples in which individuals inspired transformation come to mind: one of my professors, Colin Jerolmack, explained that he knows he has had an impact when undergraduate students, who are not familiar with the field of Animal Studies, come to him at the end of a session to let him know that they have become vegetarian or vegan because of a course of studies and the knowledge they have drawn from it. Another individual \u2013 demonstrating systemic change \u2013 is Rachel Atcheson: she implemented many initiatives within New York City and, together with Eric Adams, they are working to reshape structures and enable systemic advancement with regard to animals. These examples show how individuals can have a broad impact and generate systemic transformation. I am hopeful that Colin Jerolmack and Rachel Atcheson will inspire others to transform their view on, and their behaviors towards, animals.</p><p>We have now outlined arguments in favor of, and against, inspiration. In this concluding section, we shall explore various ways in which inspiration may generate added value to other EAA approaches.<br>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>4) Conclusion</strong></p><p>In conclusion, inspiration harbors a certain power, and it can enable change. But, is inspiration effective in EAA? This remains to be determined; further empirical research should be conducted. We are hopeful that inspiration is effective, even if non-quantifiable; but many obstacles must be overcome. We consider this essay as an investigative effort and our claims are hypothetical. We wish to err on the side of caution, given the generality and the empirical validity of our claims.</p><p>As we have seen in this essay, inspiration-based narratives in EAA come with costs and benefits, and they should be used when assessed as necessary for the purpose of a specific intervention. For the time being, we should consider inspiration as an exploratory tool that has potential. Inspiration can be part of an effective tool-kit in EAA because of its spontaneous nature, as well as the change, the engagement and motivation that it can induce, which go beyond individuals and may transform an entire system. This change may be incremental, long-term, diffused and indirect \u2013 but it still offers a shift towards better animal protection, consideration and care. Reality is complex: it is a combination of inspiration and other approaches to EAA, and it is a combination of individual transformation and systemic change. In practice, we should aim for a mix of approaches to engage in grassroots capacity-building, to create a movement large enough that can transform the system and the individuals within it (\u201cthe 3.5% threshold\u201d) (Chenoweth, Stephan &amp; Stephan, 2011).</p><p><br><strong>References</strong></p><p>Chenoweth, E., Stephan, M.

Those who did were often criticized for ruffling too many feathers. After all, why go to the trouble of mentioning that some fields weren\u2019t reproducible or high-quality? Top professors at Harvard and Princeton even accused their own colleagues of being \u201c<a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/susan-fiske-methodological-terrorism-2016-9\"><u>methodological terrorists</u></a>\u201d and the like, just for supporting replication and high-quality statistics.</p><p>The situation seems far different today. Preregistration has become <a href=\"https://www.socialscienceregistry.org/\"><u>much more common</u></a> across many fields; the American Economic Association now employs a whole team of people to <a href=\"https://aeadataeditor.github.io/\"><u>rerun the data and code</u></a> from every published article; national policymakers at NIH and the White House have launched numerous initiatives on reproducibility and <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/ostp/news-updates/2022/08/25/ostp-issues-guidance-to-make-federally-funded-research-freely-available-without-delay/\"><u>open science</u></a>; and just recently, the National Academies hosted the <a href=\"https://metascience.info/\"><u>Metascience 2023 conference</u></a>.</p><p>How did we get from there to here? In significant part, it was because of \u201cmetascience entrepreneurs,\u201d to use <a href=\"https://scienceplusplus.org/metascience/index.html\"><u>a term from a brilliant monograph by Michael Nielsen and Kanjun Qiu</u></a>. Such entrepreneurs included folks like Brian Nosek of the Center for Open Science, and many more.</p><p>But if there were metascience entrepreneurs, I played a significant part as a <i>metascience venture capitalist</i>\u2014not the only one, but the most active. While I worked at what was initially known as the Laura and John Arnold Foundation (now publicly known as <a href=\"https://www.arnoldventures.org/\"><u>Arnold Ventures</u></a>), I funded some of the most prominent metascience entrepreneurs of the past 11 years, and often was an active participant in their work. The grants I made totaled over $60 million dollars. All of that was thanks to the approval of Laura and John Arnold themselves (John made several billion dollars running a hedge fund, and they <a href=\"https://www.chron.com/news/houston-texas/article/houston-billionaire-trader-john-arnold-retiring-3530371.php\"><u>retired at 38</u></a> with the intention of giving away 90+% of their wealth).</p><p>In the past few months, two people in the metascience world independently asked if I had ever written up my perspective on being a metascience VC. This essay was the result. I\u2019ve done my best not to betray any confidentialities or to talk about anyone at Arnold Ventures other than myself. I have run this essay by many people (including John Arnold) to make sure my memory was correct. Any errors or matters of opinion are mine alone.</p><p><i><strong>The Origin Story</strong></i><strong>: How the Arnold Foundation Got Involved in Metascience</strong></p><p>As I have often said in public speeches, I trace the Arnold Foundation\u2019s interest in metascience to a conversation that I had with John Arnold in mid-2012.</p><p>I had started working as the foundation\u2019s first director of research a few months prior. John Arnold and I had a conference call with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Manzi\"><u>Jim Manzi</u></a>, the author of a <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Uncontrolled-Surprising-Trial-Error-Business/dp/046502324X\"><u>widely-heralded book</u></a> on evidence-based policy.</p><p>I don\u2019t remember much about the call itself (other than that Manzi was skeptical that a foundation could do much to promote evidence-based policy), but I do remember what happened afterwards. John Arnold asked me if I had seen a then-recent story about a psychology professor at Yale (<a href=\"https://psychology.yale.edu/people/john-bargh\"><u>John Bargh</u></a>) whose work wouldn\u2019t replicate and who was extraordinarily upset about it.</p><p>As it turned out, I had seen the <a href=\"https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/failed-replication-bargh-psychology-study-doyen\"><u>exact same story</u></a> in the news. It was quite the tempest in a teapot. Bargh had accused the folks replicating his work of being empty-headed, while Nobel Laureate Daniel Kahneman eventually <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/news/polopoly_fs/7.6716.1349271308!/suppinfoFile/Kahneman%20Letter.pdf\"><u>jumped in</u></a> to say that the \u201ctrain wreck\u201d in psychological science could be avoided only by doing more replications.</p><p>In any event, John Arnold and I had an energetic conversation about what it meant for the prospect of evidence-based policy if much of the \u201cevidence\u201d might not, in fact, be true or replicable (and still other evidence remained unpublished).</p><p>I began a more systematic investigation of the issue. It turned out that across many different fields, highly-qualified folks had occasionally gotten up the courage to write papers that said something along the lines of, \u201cOur field is publishing way too many positive results, because of how biased our methods are, and you basically can\u2019t trust our field.\u201d And there was the famous 2005 article from John Ioannidis: \u201c<a href=\"https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.0020124\"><u>Why Most Published Research Findings Are False</u></a>.\u201d To be sure, the Ioannidis article was just an estimate based on assumptions about statistical power, likely effect sizes, and research flexibility, but to me, it still made a decent case that research standards were so low that the academic literature was often indistinguishable from noise.</p><p>That\u2019s a huge problem for evidence-based policy! If your goal in philanthropy is to give money to evidence-based programs in everything from criminal justice to education to poverty reduction, what if the \u201cevidence\u201d isn\u2019t actually very good? After all, scholars can cherrypick the results in the course of doing a study, and then journals can cherrypick what to publish at all. At the end of the day, it\u2019s hard to know if the published literature actually represents a fair-minded and evidence-based view.</p><p>As a result, the Arnolds asked me to start thinking about how to fix the problems of publication bias, cherrypicking, misuse of statistics, inaccurate reporting, and more.</p><p>These aren\u2019t easy problems to solve, not by any means. Yes, there are many technical solutions that are on offer, but mere technical solutions don\u2019t address the fact that scholars still have a huge incentive to come up with positive and exciting results.</p><p>But I had to start somewhere. So I started with what I knew . . .</p><p><strong>Brian Nosek and the Birth of the Center for Open Science</strong></p><p>I had already come across Brian Nosek after an April 2012 article in the <i>Chronicle of Higher Education</i> titled \u201c<a href=\"https://www.chronicle.com/blogs/percolator/is-psychology-about-to-come-undone\"><u>Is Psychology About to Come Undone?</u></a>\u201d I was impressed by his efforts to work on improving standards in psychology. To be sure, I don\u2019t normally remember what articles I saw in a specific month over 11 years ago, but in searching back through my Gmail, I saw that I had emailed Peter Attia (who recently published <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Outlive-Longevity-Peter-Attia-MD/dp/0593236599/\"><u>an excellent book</u></a>!) and Gary Taubes about this article at the time.</p><p>Which could lead to another long story in itself: the Arnolds were interested in funding innovative nutrition research, and I advised them on setting up the Nutrition Science Initiative led by Attia and Taubes (<a href=\"https://www.wired.com/2014/08/what-makes-us-fat/\"><u>here\u2019s an article</u></a> in <i>Wired</i> from 2014). As of early 2012, I was talking with Attia and Taubes about how to improve nutrition science, and wondered what they thought of Nosek\u2019s parallel efforts in psychology.</p><p>In any event, as of summer 2012, I had a new charge to look into scientific integrity more broadly. I liked Nosek\u2019s idea of <a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1745691612462588\"><u>running psychology replication experiments</u></a>, his efforts to mentor a then-graduate student (Jeff Spies) in creating the Open Science Framework software, and in particular, a pair of articles titled <i>Scientific Utopia I</i> and <i>Scientific Utopia II</i>.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1205.1055\"><u>first article</u></a> laid out a new vision for scientific communication: \u201c(1) full embrace of digital communication, (2) open access to all published research, (3) disentangling publication from evaluation, (4) breaking the \u2018one article, one journal\u2019 model with a grading system for evaluation and diversified dissemination outlets, (5) publishing peer review, and, (6) allowing open, continuous peer review.\u201d The <a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1745691612459058\"><u>second article</u></a> focused on \u201crestructuring incentives and practices to promote truth over publishability.\u201d</p><p>Even with the benefit of hindsight, I\u2019m still impressed with the vision that Nosek and his co-authors laid out. One of the first things I remember doing was setting up a call with Brian. I then invited him out to Houston to meet with the Arnolds and the then-president of the Arnold Foundation (Denis).</p><p>At that point, no one knew where any of this would lead. As Brian himself has said, his goal at that point was to get us to fund a post-doc position at maybe $50k a year.</p><p>For my part, I thought that <i>if you find smart people doing great things in their spare time, empowering them with additional capital is a good bet</i>. I continue to think that principle is true, whether in philanthropy, business, or science.</p><p>After the meeting, Denis said that he and Arnolds had loved Brian\u2019s vision and ideas. He said something like, \u201cCan\u2019t we get him to leave the University of Virginia and do his own thing full-time?\u201d Out of that conversation, we came up with the name \u201cCenter for Open Science.\u201d I went back to Brian and said that the Arnolds liked his vision, and asked if he would be willing to start up a \u201cCenter for Open Science\u201d? Brian wasn\u2019t hard to persuade, as the offer was consistent with his vision for science, yet far beyond what he had hoped to ask for.</p><p>He and I worked together on a proposal. In fact, in my Google Docs, I still have a draft from November 2012 titled, \u201cCenter for Open Science: Scenario Planning.\u201d The introduction and goal:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cWe aim to promote open science, evaluate or improve reproducibility of scientific findings, and improve the alignment of scientific practices to scientific values. Funding will ensure, accelerate, and broaden impact of our projects. All projects are interdisciplinary or are models to replicate across disciplines. The Center for Open Science (COS) will support innovation, open practices, and reproducibility in the service of knowledge-building. COS would have significant visibility to advance an open science agenda; establish and disseminate open science best practices; coordinate and negotiate with funders, journals, and IRBs for open science principles; support and manage open infrastructure; connect siloed communities particularly across disciplines; and, support open science research objectives.\u201d</p></blockquote><p>More than 10 years later, that\u2019s still a fairly good description of what COS has been able to accomplish.&nbsp;</p><p>As of September 2013, there was a Google doc that included the following:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Mission</strong></p><p>COS aims to increase openness, integrity, and reproducibility of scientific research.</p><p>Openness and reproducibility are core scientific values because science is a distributed, non-hierarchical culture for accumulating knowledge.&nbsp; No individual is the arbiter of truth.&nbsp; Knowledge accumulates by sharing information and independently reproducing results. Ironically, the reward structure for scientists does not provide incentives for individuals to pursue openness and reproducibility.&nbsp; As a consequence, they are not common practices.&nbsp; We will nudge incentives to align scientific practices with scientific values.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Summary of Implementation Objectives</strong><br><br>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Increase prevalence of scientific values - openness, reproducibility - in scientific practice</p><p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href=\"http://openscienceframework.org/\"><u>Develop and maintain infrastructure</u></a> for documentation, archiving, sharing, and registering research materials</p><p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Join infrastructures to support the entire scientific workflow in a common framework</p><p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Foster an interdisciplinary community of open source developers, scientists, and organizations</p><p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href=\"http://pps.sagepub.com/content/7/6/615.full\"><u>Adjust incentives</u></a> to make \u201cgetting it right\u201d more competitive with \u201cgetting it published\u201d&nbsp;</p><p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Make all academic research <a href=\"http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/1047840X.2012.692215#.UfFwGmTJG6c\"><u>discoverable and accessible</u></a></p></blockquote><p>Not bad. I eventually was satisfied that the proposal was worth bringing back to the Arnolds, and asking for $5.25 million. That\u2019s what we gave Brian as the first of several large operational grants\u2014$5 million was designated for operational costs for running the Center for Open Science for the first three years, and $250k was for completing 100 psychology replication experiments.</p><p>We were off to the races.</p><p><strong>Interlude</strong></p><p>From this point forward, I won\u2019t narrate all of the grants and activities chronologically, but according to broader themes that are admittedly a bit retrofitted. Specifically, I\u2019m now a fan of the <a href=\"https://www.cos.io/blog/strategy-for-culture-change\"><u>pyramid of social change</u></a> that Brian Nosek has written and talked about for a few years:</p><p><a href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faced8a58-2c0f-4a03-b5ff-e64fc2fb7d45_793x456.png\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faced8a58-2c0f-4a03-b5ff-e64fc2fb7d45_793x456.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faced8a58-2c0f-4a03-b5ff-e64fc2fb7d45_793x456.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faced8a58-2c0f-4a03-b5ff-e64fc2fb7d45_793x456.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faced8a58-2c0f-4a03-b5ff-e64fc2fb7d45_793x456.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faced8a58-2c0f-4a03-b5ff-e64fc2fb7d45_793x456.png 1456w\"></a></p><p>In other words, if you want scientists to change their behavior by sharing more data, you need to start at the bottom by making it <i>possible</i> to share data (i.e., by building data repositories). Then try to make it easier and more streamlined, so that sharing data isn\u2019t a huge burden. And so on, up the pyramid.</p><p>You can\u2019t start at the top of the pyramid (\u201cmake it required\u201d) if the other components aren\u2019t there first. For one thing, no one is going to vote for a journal or funder policy to mandate data sharing if it isn\u2019t even possible. Getting buy-in for such a policy would require work to make data sharing not just possible, but more normative and rewarding within a field.</p><p>That said, I might add another layer at the bottom of the pyramid: \u201cRaise awareness of the problem.\u201d For example, doing meta-research on the extent of publication bias or the rate of replication can make entire fields aware that they have a problem in the first place\u2014before that, they aren\u2019t as interested in potential remedies for improving research behaviors.</p><p>The rest of this piece will be organized accordingly:</p><p><i>Raise Awareness: </i>fundamental research on the extent of irreproducibility;</p><p><i>Make It Possible and Make It Easy:</i> the development of software, databases, and other tools to help improve scientific practices;</p><p><i>Make It Normative: </i>journalists and websites that called out problematic research, and better standards/guidelines/ratings related to research quality and/or transparency;</p><p><i>Make It Rewarding</i>: community-building efforts and new journal formats</p><p><i>Make It Required</i>: organizations that worked on policy and advocacy.</p><p>Disclaimer: As applied to Arnold grantmaking in hindsight, these categories aren\u2019t comprehensive or mutually exclusive, and are somewhat retrofitted. They won\u2019t be a perfect fit. &nbsp;</p><h3><i><strong>I.&nbsp;&nbsp;Raise Awareness Via Fundamental Research</strong></i></h3><p><i><strong>The Meta-Research Innovation Center at Stanford (METRICS)</strong></i></p><p>Around the 2012-13 time frame, I read about Dustin Moskovitz and his partner Cari Tuna (it was something akin to <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/billionaire-couple-give-plenty-to-charity-but-they-do-quite-a-bit-of-homework/2014/12/26/19fae34c-86d6-11e4-b9b7-b8632ae73d25_story.html\"><u>this article</u></a> from 2014), and their ambitions to engage in effective philanthropy. I asked John Arnold if he knew them, or how to get in touch with them. I ended up being redirected to Holden Karnofsky and Alexander Berger, who at the time worked at <a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/\"><u>GiveWell</u></a> (and since helped launch and run <a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/\"><u>Open Philanthropy</u></a>).</p><p>It turned out that they had been tentatively exploring metascience as well. They introduced me to Steve Goodman and John Ioannidis at Stanford, who had been thinking about the possibility of a center at Stanford focused on meta-research. Goodman sent along a 2-page (or so) document with the general idea, and I worked with him to produce a longer proposal.</p><p>My memory is no match for what Holden <a href=\"https://blog.givewell.org/2014/04/23/meta-research-innovation-centre-at-stanford-metrics/\"><u>wrote at the time</u></a> (more funders should do this while memories are still fresh!):</p><blockquote><p>In 2012, we investigated the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://blog.givewell.org/2012/09/27/us-cochrane-center-uscc-gets-our-first-quick-grant-recommendation/\"><strong><u>US Cochrane Center</u></strong></a>, in line with the then-high priority we placed on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://blog.givewell.org/2012/06/11/meta-research/\"><strong><u>meta-research</u></strong></a>. As part of our investigation, we were connected \u2013 through our network \u2013 to Dr. Steven Goodman, who discussed Cochrane with us (<a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/files/metaresearch/Conversation%20with%20Steven%20Goodman%20summary%202012%2005%2031%20final.pdf\"><strong><u>notes</u></strong></a>). We also asked him about other underfunded areas in medical research, and among others he mentioned the idea of \u201cassessing or improving the quality of evidence in the medical literature\u201d and the idea of establishing a center for such work.</p><p>During our follow-up email exchange with Dr. Goodman, we mentioned that we were thinking of meta-research in general as a high priority, and sent him a link to our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://blog.givewell.org/2012/06/11/meta-research/\"><strong><u>standing thoughts on the subject</u></strong></a>. He responded, \u201cI didn\u2019t know of your specific interest in meta-research and open science \u2026 Further developing the science and policy responses to challenges to the integrity of the medical literature is also the raison d\u2019etre of the center I cursorily outlined, which is hard to describe to folks who don\u2019t really know the area; I didn\u2019t realize how far down that road you were.\u201d He mentioned that he could send along a short proposal, and we said we\u2019d like to see it.</p><p>At the same time, we were in informal conversations with Stuart Buck at the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://ljaf.org/\"><strong><u>Laura and John Arnold Foundation (LJAF)</u></strong></a>&nbsp;about the general topic of meta-research. LJAF had expressed enthusiasm over the idea of the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://centerforopenscience.org/\"><strong><u>Center for Open Science</u></strong></a>&nbsp;(which it now supports), and generally seemed interested in the topic of reproducibility in the social sciences. I asked Stuart whether he would be interested in doing some funding related to the field of medicine as well, and in reviewing a proposal in that area that I thought looked quite promising. He said yes, and (after checking with Dr. Goodman) I sent along the proposal.</p><p>From that point on, LJAF followed its own process, though we stayed posted on the progress, reviewed a more fleshed-out proposal, shared our informal thoughts with LJAF, and joined (by videoconference) a meeting between LJAF staff and Drs. Ioannidis and Goodman.</p><p>Following the meeting with Drs. Ioannidis and Goodman, we told Stuart that we would consider providing a modest amount of co-funding (~10%) for the initial needs of METRICS. He said this wouldn\u2019t be necessary as LJAF planned to provide the initial funding.</p></blockquote><p>We (at the Arnold Foundation) ended up committing some <a href=\"https://www.arnoldventures.org/grants/the-board-of-trustees-of-the-leland-stanford-junior-university-28\"><u>$4.9 million dollars</u></a> to launch the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://metrics.stanford.edu/\"><u>Meta-Research Innovation Center at Stanford</u></a>, or METRICS. The goal was to produce more research (along with conferences, reports, etc.) on how to improve research quality in biomedicine, and to train the next generation of scholars in this field. METRICS did that in spades: they and their associated scholars published hundreds of papers on meta-science (mostly in biomedicine), and were able to hire quite a few postdocs to help create a future generation of scholars who focus on meta-science.</p><p>In 2015, METRICS hosted an international conference on meta-research that was well-attended by many disciplinary leaders. The journalist Christie Aschwanden was there, and she went around ambushing the attendees (including me) by asking politely, \u201cI\u2019m a journalist, would you mind answering a few questions on video?,\u201d and then following that with, \u201cIn layman\u2019s terms, can you explain what is a p-value?\u201d The result was a hilarious \u201ceducational\u201d video and article, still available&nbsp;<a href=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/not-even-scientists-can-easily-explain-p-values/\"><u>here</u></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Steve Goodman has continued to do good work at Stanford, and is leading the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://med.stanford.edu/sporr\"><u>Stanford Program on Research Rigor and Reproducibility</u></a> (SPORR), a wide-ranging program whose goal is to \u201cmaximize the scientific value of all research performed in the Stanford School of Medicine.\u201d SPORR now hands out&nbsp;<a href=\"https://med.stanford.edu/sporr/rewards/Awards.html\"><u>several awards a year</u></a>&nbsp;for Stanford affiliates who have taken significant steps to improve research rigor or reproducibility that can be used or modeled by others. It has also successfully incorporated those considerations into Stanford medical school\u2019s promotion process and is working with leadership on institutional metrics for informative research.</p><p>The goal is to create \u201cculture change\u201d within Stanford and as a model for other academic institutions, so that good science practices are rewarded and encouraged by university officials (rather than just adding more publications to one\u2019s CV).&nbsp;SPORR is arguably the best school-wide program in this regard, and it should be a model for other colleges and universities.</p><p><i><strong>Bringing Ben Goldacre to Oxford</strong></i></p><p>In the early 2010s, Ben Goldacre was both a practicing doctor in the UK and a professional advocate as to clinical trial transparency. He co-founded an EU-wide campaign called <a href=\"https://www.alltrials.net/\"><u>AllTrials</u></a> on clinical trial transparency; wrote the book <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Bad-Pharma-Companies-Mislead-Patients/dp/0865478007\"><u>Bad Pharma</u></a> (which both John Arnold and I read at the time); and wrote <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20131206170213/http:/media.education.gov.uk/assets/files/pdf/b/ben%20goldacre%20paper.pdf\"><u>a nice essay</u></a> on using randomized trials in education.</p><p>As I mentioned above, when someone is doing all of this in his spare time, a good bet would be to use philanthropy (or investment, depending on the sector) to enable that person to do greater things.</p><p>I reached out to Ben Goldacre in late 2013 or early 2014 (the timing is a bit unclear in my memory). I ended up sending the Arnolds an email titled, \u201cThe \u2018Set Ben Goldacre Free\u2019 Grant,\u201d or something close to it.</p><p>My pitch was simple: We should enable Goldacre to pursue his many ideas as to data and evidence-based medicine, rather than being forced to do so in his spare time while working as a doctor by day.</p><p>I asked Goldacre if we could set him up with a university-based center or appointment. Unlike Brian Nosek, it took quite a bit of argument in this case. Goldacre was in the middle of buying a house in London. He wasn\u2019t sure he could find such a good deal again, and he wanted to be very certain of our intentions before he backed out of the London house and moved anywhere else, such as Oxford (which itself was uncertain!). I eventually convinced him that the Arnold Foundation was good for its word, and that it was worth the move. We worked out the details with Oxford, and Arnold made a <a href=\"https://www.arnoldventures.org/grants/the-chancellor-masters-and-scholars-of-the-university-of-oxford-3\"><u>5-year grant</u></a> of $1.24 million in 2014.</p><p>Since then, Goldacre has thrived at Oxford. He spearheaded the <a href=\"https://www.trialstracker.net/\"><u>TrialsTracker Project</u></a> (which tracks which clinical trials have abided by legal obligations to report their results), and the <a href=\"https://www.compare-trials.org/\"><u>COMPARE Project</u></a> (which systematically looked at every trial published in the top 5 medical journals over a several-month period).</p><p>The latter\u2019s findings were remarkable: out of 67 trials reviewed, only nine were perfect in their reporting. The other 58 had a collective 357 new outcomes \u201csilently added\u201d and 354 outcomes not reported at all (despite having been declared in advance). This is an indictment of the medical literature and of the ideal that clinical trials should register in advance and then report fully when done.</p><p>But it was an amazingly tedious project: while in the middle of all this work checking trial outcomes, Goldacre told me, \u201c<i>I rue the day</i> I ever said I would do this.\u201d It\u2019s no wonder that hardly anyone else ever does this sort of work, and medical journals (among others) need better and more automated ways to check whether a publication is consistent with (or even contradicts) its registration, protocol, or statistical analysis plan. &nbsp;</p><p>Goldacre\u2019s lab is now called the <a href=\"https://www.bennett.ox.ac.uk/about-us/ben-goldacre/\"><u>Bennet Institute for Applied Data Science</u></a>, after a subsequent donor. The Institute maintains the <a href=\"https://www.opensafely.org/\"><u>OpenSafely project</u></a>, which offers researchers access to well-curated medical records from 58 million people across the entire UK, as well as <a href=\"https://openprescribing.net/\"><u>Open Prescribing</u></a>, which does the same for prescription data. These efforts have led to many publications, particularly during Covid.</p><p>OpenSafely is especially interesting: despite the highly private nature of health data, Goldacre created <a href=\"https://www.opensafely.org/about/#core-design-features-for-privacy-transparency-and-open-working\"><u>a system in which</u></a> \u201cusers are blocked from directly viewing the raw patient data or the research ready datasets, but still write code as if they were in a live data environment.\u201d Instead, \u201cthe data management tools used to produce their research-ready datasets also produce simulated, randomly generated \u2018dummy data\u2019 that has the same structure as the real data, but none of the disclosive risks.\u201d</p><p>Oxford professor Dorothy Bishop <a href=\"https://twitter.com/deevybee/status/1677996408526319617\"><u>calls it</u></a> a \u201cphenomenal solution for using public data.\u201d I think that federal and state governments in the US should do more to create similarly streamlined ways for researchers to easily analyze private data.</p><p>Goldacre recently gave his inaugural professorial lecture as the first Bennett Professor of Evidence Based Medicine in the Nuffield Department of Primary Care Health Sciences at Oxford. I\u2019m pleased to have helped Goldacre along this path.</p><p><i><strong>Open Trials</strong></i></p><p>A significant problem with clinical trials, so it seemed to me, was that if a patient or doctor wanted to know the full spectrum of information about a drug or a trial, it required an enormous amount of effort and insider knowledge to track down. For example, you\u2019d have to know:</p><ul><li>How to search the medical literature,</li><li>How to look up trials on ClinicalTrials.gov,</li><li>How to check the FDA approval package (which is such a cumbersome process that the <i>British Medical Journal</i> once literally published <a href=\"https://www.bmj.com/content/347/bmj.f5992\"><u>an entire article</u></a> with instructions on how to access FDA data),</li><li>How to check for whether the European Medicines Agency had any additional information, and more.</li></ul><p>It was literally impossible to find the whole set of information about any drug or treatment in one place.</p><p>So, an idea I discussed with Ben Goldacre was creating a database/website that would pull in information about drugs from all of those places and more. If you were curious about tamoxifen (the cancer drug) or paroxetine (the antidepressant), you\u2019d be able to see the entire spectrum of all scholarly and regulatory information ever produced on that drug.</p><p>I ended up making a grant of $545,630 to the Center for Open Science to work with <a href=\"https://okfn.org/\"><u>Open Knowledge International</u></a> (now called the Open Knowledge Foundation) and Ben Goldacre on creating a platform called <a href=\"https://opentrials.net/\"><u>OpenTrials</u></a>. In theory, this was a great idea, as you can read in <a href=\"https://www.arnoldventures.org/newsroom/laura-john-arnold-foundation-announces-funding-support-creation-open-online-database-clinical-trials\"><u>our press release</u></a> at the time, or <a href=\"https://trialsjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13063-016-1290-8\"><u>this article</u></a> that Ben Goldacre published with Jonathan Gray of Open Knowledge in 2016.</p><p>In practice, it was hard to juggle and coordinate three independent groups within one grant. Folks had different ideas about the technological requirements and the path for future development. So ultimately, the grant stalled and never produced anything that was very functional.</p><p>In retrospect, I still think it\u2019s a great idea for something that ought to exist, but it is technically difficult and would require lots of ongoing maintenance. I shouldn\u2019t have tried to patch together three independent groups that each had their own ideas.</p><p><i><strong>The 2014 Controversy Over Replication in Psychology</strong></i></p><p>As of 2014, psychologists were starting to get nervous. The Reproducibility Project in Psychology was well under way, thanks to our funding, and would eventually be published in <i>Science</i> in 2015. A fair number of prominent psychological researchers knew far too well (or so I suspected) that their own work was quite flawed and likely to be irreplicable.</p><p>As a result, the 2014 time period was marked by a number of controversies over the role of replication in science, as well as the attitude and tone of debates on social media. I\u2019ll spend a bit of time describing the controversies, not because they were all that strategically important, but just because I personally found it fascinating. Also, to this day, no one has fully catalogued all of the back-and-forth accusations, much of which I found only by looking for old expired links in emails or documents, and then going to the Internet Archive.</p><p>Brian Nosek and Daniel Lakens led a small replication project for <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20141009014301/http:/www.psycontent.com/content/l67413865317/?p=1dd5ebc505f9492c8fb93be3f7c713f3&amp;pi=0\"><u>a special issue</u></a> of the journal <i>Social Psychology</i> in 2014 (with some small awards drawn out of the main COS grant). One of the replications was of a <a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1467-9280.2008.02227.x?journalCode=pssa\"><u>2008 article</u></a> by European researcher Simone Schnall, in which she and her colleagues had found that people who were primed to think about cleanliness or to cleanse themselves \u201cfound certain moral actions to be less wrong than did participants who had not been exposed to a cleanliness manipulation.\u201d</p><p>The replication <a href=\"https://psycnet.apa.org/fulltext/2014-20922-011.html\"><u>experiments</u></a> \u2013 with much bigger sample sizes \u2013 found no such effect. One of the replication authors wrote a blog post titled, \u201c<a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20140804234946/http:/traitstate.wordpress.com/2013/12/11/go-big-or-go-home-a-recent-replication-attempt/\"><u>Go Big or Go Home</u></a>.\u201d Brian Nosek, with his customary approach to openness, posted a <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ew7X0RaClU5_Ev4Ns3Uyn0I7PmjzP_Z1wKlnza_3Fe0/edit\"><u>long document</u></a> with many emails back and forth amongst Schnall, the replication team, and the journal editors\u2014all with permission, of course.</p><p>Simone Schnall then wrote a <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20140727185636/http:/www.spspblog.org/simone-schnall-on-her-experience-with-a-registered-replication-project/\"><u>long blog post</u></a> reacting to the replication and the accompanying commentary.

casting the replication debate in terms like \u201creplication police,\u201d \u201cself-appointed sherrifs [sic],\u201d \u201cgod\u2019s chosen soldiers in a great jihad,\u201d \u201cSenator Joe McCarthy\u2019s playbook,\u201d \u201cwitch hunt,\u201d \u201csecond stringers,\u201d and \u201cRosa Parks.\u201d</p><p>Instead, I bring it up to show the amount of vehement criticism in 2014 that was aimed at the Center for Open Science, Brian Nosek, and anyone trying to do replications. Since Gilbert was a prominent tenured professor at Harvard, he represented the height of the profession. We all assumed that there were other people who shared his views but were slightly less outspoken.</p><p>As for me, I not only took it in stride, but assumed that we at Arnold were doing good work. After all, replication is a core part of the scientific method. If folks like Gilbert were <i>that</i> upset, we must have struck a nerve, and one that deserved to be struck. To me, it was as if the IRS had announced that it would be auditing more tax returns of wealthy people, and then one wealthy person started preemptively complaining about a witch hunt while casting himself as Rosa Parks standing up against segregation\u2014that person might well have something to hide.</p><p>It did seem important that replications were:</p><p>Led by tenured professors at major universities, and</p><p>Funded by an outside philanthropy with no particular ax to grind and no stake in maintaining the good wishes of all psychologists everywhere.</p><p>The former made the replication efforts harder to dismiss as mere sour grapes or as the work of \u201csecond stringers\u201d (Dan Gilbert\u2019s efforts to the contrary). The latter made us at Arnold completely impervious to the complaints. I wonder if a program officer at NSF who was on a two-year leave from being a tenured professor of psychology might feel differently about antagonizing prominent members of the psychology community.</p><p><i><strong>Reproducibility Project: Psychology</strong></i></p><p>That leads us to the Reproducibility Project: Psychology, which at the time was the most ambitious replication project in history (it has since been handily surpassed by a <a href=\"https://www.socialsciencespace.com/2019/03/darpa-aims-to-score-social-and-behavioral-research/\"><u>DARPA program</u></a> that my friend Adam Russell launched in partnership with COS). The aim was to replicate 100 psychology experiments published in top journals in 2008. In the Center for Open Science grant, we included an extra $250,000 for completing the Reproducibility Project, which had started but was unlikely to be finished given the current trajectory.</p><p>The final results were <a href=\"https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aac4716\"><u>published in </u><i><u>Science</u></i></a> in 2015. Only around 40% (give or take) of the 100 experiments could definitively be replicated, while the rest were mixed or else definitely not replicable. These results took the academic world by storm. As of this writing, Google Scholar estimates that the 2015 <i>Science</i> paper has been cited over 7,500 times. It is a rare occasion when I mention this project and someone hasn\u2019t heard of it. At $250k, it was easily the highest impact grant I ever made. &nbsp;</p><p>When the project was done, I got an <a href=\"https://groups.google.com/a/cos.io/g/cos-supporters/c/VPc6s5Xj0EA\"><u>inspiring email</u></a> from Brian Nosek (it has been publicly posted on a Google Group, so this is all public knowledge). The email thanked us for supporting the project, and forwarded an email to his team thanking them for the heroic work they had done in pushing the project forward to completion. I remember finding it powerful and emotionally moving at the time, and that remains true today. It\u2019s long, but worth quoting.</p><blockquote><p><strong>From:</strong>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://groups.google.com/\"><u>bno...@gmail.com</u></a>&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://groups.google.com/\"><u>bno...@gmail.com</u></a>] on behalf of Brian Nosek [<a href=\"https://groups.google.com/\"><u>no...@virginia.edu</u></a>]<br><strong>Sent:</strong>&nbsp;Wednesday, April 22, 2015 9:58 PM<br><strong>To:</strong>&nbsp;Stuart Buck; Denis Calabrese<br><strong>Subject:</strong>&nbsp;Reproducibility Project</p><p>Dear Stuart and Denis --</p><p>Today we completed and submitted the manuscript presenting the Reproducibility Project: Psychology.&nbsp; My note to the 270 co-authors on the project is below.&nbsp; When you funded the Reproducibility Project (and COS more broadly), the collaboration was active, exciting, and a patchwork. &nbsp;</p><p>LJAF funding gave us the excuse and opportunity to make it a \"serious\" effort.&nbsp; And, even though this project represents a very small part of our operating expenses, that support made an enormous difference. &nbsp;</p><p><strong>If we had not received LJAF support, this project would have been a neat experiment with maybe a few dozen completed replications and contestable results.</strong>&nbsp; It would have received plenty of attention because of its unique approach, but I am doubtful that it would have had lasting impact. &nbsp;</p><p>With LJAF support, we had one person full-time on the project for our first year (Johanna), and two people for our second (+Mallory).&nbsp; We gave grants to replication teams and nominal payments to many others who helped in small and large ways.&nbsp; We helped all of the replication teams get their projects done, and then we audited their work, re-doing all of their analyses independently.&nbsp; We supported a small team to make sure that the project itself demonstrated all of the values and practices that comprise our mission.&nbsp; And, I could devote the time needed to make sure the project was done well.&nbsp; The project has been a centerpiece in the office for our two years of existence.&nbsp; Even though few in the office are working on it directly, they are all aware of the importance that it has for the mission of the organization.&nbsp; <strong>LJAF's support transformed this project from one that would have gotten lots of attention, to one that I believe will have a transformative impact. &nbsp;</strong></p><p>I often tell my lab and the COS team about one of my favorite quotes for how we do our business.&nbsp; Bill Moyers asked Steve Martin, \"What's the secret of success?\" Steve responded, \"Be so damn good that they can't ignore you.\"</p><p>LJAF funding gave us the opportunity to do this project in the best way that we could.&nbsp; Regardless of predictions, my thanks to both of you, Laura, and John for supporting this project and giving us the opportunity to do it well.&nbsp; I am so proud of it.&nbsp; I am confident that the scientific community will not be able to ignore it.</p><p>Best,</p><p>Brian</p><p>---------- Forwarded message ----------<br>From:&nbsp;<strong>Brian Nosek</strong>&nbsp;&lt;<a href=\"https://groups.google.com/\"><u>no...@virginia.edu</u></a>&gt;<br>Date: Wed, Apr 22, 2015 at 10:50 PM<br>Subject: This is the end, or perhaps the beginning?<br>To: \"Reproducibility Project: Psychology Team\" &lt;<a href=\"https://groups.google.com/\"><u>cos-reproducibility...@lists.cos.io</u></a>&gt;<br><br>Colleagues --</p><p>I am attaching the submitted version of our Reproducibility Project: Psychology manuscript. &nbsp;[Figures need a bit of tweaking still for final version, but otherwise done.]</p><p>The seeds of this project were brewing with a few small-scale efforts in 2009 and 2010, and officially launched on November 4, 2011.&nbsp; Now, 3.5 years later, we have produced what must be the largest collective effort in the history of psychology.&nbsp; Moreover, the evidence is strong, and the findings are provocative. &nbsp;</p><p>For years, psychology conferences, journals, social media, and the general media has been filled with discussion of reproducibility.&nbsp; Is there a problem?&nbsp; How big is the problem?&nbsp; What should we do about it?&nbsp; Most of that discussion has been based on anecdote, small examples, logical analysis, simulation, or indirect inferences based on the available literature.&nbsp; Our project will ground this discussion in data.&nbsp; We cannot expect that our evidence will produce a sudden consensus, nor should it.&nbsp; But, we should expect that this paper will facilitate and mature the debate.&nbsp; That alone will be a substantial contribution. &nbsp;</p><p><strong>To me, what is most remarkable about this project is that we did it.</strong> &nbsp;270 authors and 86 volunteers contributed some or a lot of their time to the Reproducibility Project.&nbsp; If researchers were just self-interested actors, this could not have occurred.&nbsp; In the current reward system, no one is going to get a job or keep a job as an author on this paper. &nbsp;</p><p>. . .</p><p>The project will get a lot of attention.&nbsp; That won't necessarily be positive attention all the time, but it will get attention.&nbsp; I will receive much more than my share of attention and credit than I deserve based on our respective contributions.&nbsp; For that, I apologize in advance.&nbsp; In part, it is an unavoidable feature of large projects/teams.&nbsp; There is strong desire to talk about/through a single person.&nbsp;</p><p>But, there are also things that we can do to reduce it, and amplify the fact that this project exists because of the collective action of all, not the individual contribution of any.&nbsp; One part of that will be getting as many of us involved in the press/media coverage about the project as possible.&nbsp; Another part will be getting many of us involved in the presentations, posters, and discussions with our colleagues.&nbsp; We can emphasize the team, and correct colleagues when they say \"Oh, Brian's project?\" by responding \"Well, Brian and 269 others, including me.\" &nbsp;[And, if they hate the project, do feel free to respond \"Oh, yes, Brian's project.\"] &nbsp;</p><p>We all deserve credit for this work, and we can and should do what we can to ensure that everyone receives it.&nbsp; Does anyone know how to easily create a short video of the author list as a credit reel that we could all put into presentations? &nbsp;</p><p>Here, it would be difficult to call-out the contributions of everyone.&nbsp; I will mention just a few:</p><p>* Elizabeth Bartmess moved this fledgling project into a real thing when she started volunteering as a project coordinator in its early days.&nbsp; She was instrumental in turning the project from an interesting idea to a project that people realized could actually get done.</p><p>* Alexander Aarts made countless contributions at every step of the process - coding articles, editing manuscripts, reviewing submission requirements, and on on on.&nbsp; Much of getting the reporting details right is because of his superb contributions.</p><p>* Marcel van Assen, Chris Hartgerink, and Robbie van Aert led the meta-analysis of all the projects, pushing, twisting, and cajoling the diverse research applications into a single dataset.&nbsp; This was a huge effort over the last many weeks.&nbsp; That is reflected in the extensive analysis report in the supplementary information.</p><p>* Fred Hasselman led the creation of the beautiful figures for the main text of the report and provided much support to the analysis team.</p><p>* And, OBVIOUSLY, Johanna Cohoon and Mallory Kidwell are the pillars of this project.&nbsp; Last summer, more than 2 years in, it looked we wouldn't get much past 30 completed replications.&nbsp; Johanna and Mallory buckled down, wrote 100 on the wall, and pursued a steady press on the rest of us to get this done.&nbsp; They sent you (and me) thousands of emails, organized hundreds of tasks, wrote dozens of reports, organized countless materials, and just did whatever needed to be done to hit 100.&nbsp; They deserve hearty congratulations for pulling this off.&nbsp; Your email inbox will be lonely without them.</p><p>This short list massively under-represents all of the contributions to the project.&nbsp; So, I just say thank you.&nbsp; Thank you for your contributions.&nbsp; I get very emotional thinking about how so many of you did so much to get this done.&nbsp; I hope that you are as proud of the output as I am. &nbsp;</p><p>Warm regards,</p><p>Brian</p></blockquote><p>That was a long email.

In 2011-12, both <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/483531a\"><u>Amgen</u></a> and <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/nrd3439-c1\"><u>Bayer</u></a> published articles bemoaning how rarely they were able to reproduce the academic literature, despite wanting desperately to do so (in order to find a drug to bring to market).</p><p>The Amgen findings were particularly dismal\u2014they could replicate the literature only 11% of the time (6 out of 53 cases). I heard a similar message in private from top executives at Pfizer and Abbvie, with the gist being: \u201cWe always try to replicate an academic finding before carrying it forward, but we can\u2019t get it to work 2/3rds of the time.\u201d</p><p>Keep in mind that while pharma companies have a reputation (often justified) for trying to skew the results of clinical trials in their favor, they have no incentive to \u201cdisprove\u201d or \u201cfail to replicate\u201d early-stage lab studies. Quite the contrary\u2014they have every incentive to figure out a way to make it work if at all possible, so that they can carry forward a research program with a solid drug candidate. The fact that pharma companies <i>still</i> have such trouble replicating academic work is a real problem.</p><p>Around that time, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Iorns\"><u>Elizabeth Iorns</u></a> launched the Reproducibility Initiative to address the problems of cancer biology. I ended up funding her in partnership with the Center for Open Science (where <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/tim-errington-558a928/\"><u>Tim Errington</u></a> led the effort) to try to replicate 50 cancer biology papers from top journals (<a href=\"https://www.science.org/content/article/complete-repeat-initiative-gets-13-million-try-replicate-cancer-studies\"><u>some coverage from </u><i><u>Science</u></i></a> at the time).</p><p>The project was quite a journey. It took longer than expected, cost more (they had to ask for supplemental funding at one point), and completed far fewer replications (only 23 papers, not 50). This might look like the project was inefficient in every possible way, but that wasn\u2019t the case at all. The reason was that the underlying literature was so inadequate that the project leaders were never able to start a replication experiment without reaching out the original authors and labs. Never. Not even one case where they could just start up the replication experiment.</p><p>The original authors and labs weren\u2019t always cooperative either\u2014only 41% of the time. Indeed, the replicators were <a href=\"https://elifesciences.org/articles/67995\"><u>unable to figure out</u></a> the basic descriptive and inferential statistics for 68% of the original experiments, even with the authors\u2019 help (where provided)!</p><p>The <a href=\"https://elifesciences.org/articles/71601\"><u>end results</u></a>? For studies where one could calculate an effect size (such as, how many days does a cancerous mouse survive with a particular drug?), the replication effect was on average 85% smaller than the original (e.g., the mouse survived 3 days rather than 20 days). And for studies where the effect was binary (yes-no), the replication rate was 46%. In any case, it looked like the original effects were overestimated compared to the replications.</p><p>As for what this implies for the field of cancer biology, see coverage in <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/some-cancer-studies-fail-to-replicate-that-might-be-ok/\"><i><u>Wired</u></i></a>, <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-03691-0\"><i><u>Nature</u></i></a>, and <a href=\"https://www.science.org/content/article/more-half-high-impact-cancer-lab-studies-could-not-be-replicated-controversial-analysis\"><i><u>Science</u></i></a>.

These and other examples suggested that misreported (or unreported) clinical trials could lead to significant public expense and even public harms.</p><p>Doshi and co-authors (including the famous Kay Dickersin) <a href=\"https://www.bmj.com/content/346/bmj.f2865\"><u>wrote a piece in 2013</u></a> calling for \u201crestoring invisible and abandoned trials.\u201d They gave numerous examples of trial information (drawn from documents made public via litigation or in Europe) that had been withheld from the public:</p><blockquote><p>The documents we have obtained include trial reports for studies that remain unpublished years after completion (such as Roche\u2019s study M76001, the largest treatment trial of oseltamivir, and Pfizer\u2019s study A945-1008, the largest trial of gabapentin for painful diabetic neuropathy). We also have thousands of pages of clinical study reports associated with trials that have been published in scientific journals but shown to contain inaccuracies, such as Roche\u2019s oseltamivir study WV15671, GlaxoSmithKline\u2019s paroxetine study 329, and Pfizer\u2019s gabapentin study 945-291. We consider these to be examples of abandoned trials: either unpublished trials for which sponsors are no longer actively working to publish or published trials that are documented as misreported but for which authors do not correct the record using established means such as a correction or retraction (which is an abandonment of responsibility) (box 1).Because abandonment can lead to false conclusions about effectiveness and safety, we believe that it should be tackled through independent publication and republication of trials.</p></blockquote><p>In 2017, I was able to award a <a href=\"https://www.arnoldventures.org/grants/university-of-maryland-5\"><u>grant</u></a> to Peter Doshi of $1.44 million to set up the <a href=\"https://restoringtrials.org/\"><u>RIAT Support Center</u></a>\u2014with RIAT standing for Restoring Invisible and Abandoned Trials. Doshi\u2019s Center, in turn, made <a href=\"https://restoringtrials.org/riat-studies/funded-projects/\"><u>several smaller grants to outside researchers</u></a> to reanalyze important clinical trials in areas ranging from cardiovascular disease to depression to nerve pain (gabapentin specifically).</p><p><i><strong>I continue to think that this kind of work is vastly undersupplied</strong></i><strong>.</strong> Few people have the resources, patience, or the academic incentive to spend years poring through potentially thousands of documents (including patient records) just to reanalyze one clinical trial to see whether the benefits and adverse events were accurately recorded. NIH should set aside, say, $5 million a year for this purpose, which be a pittance compared to what it spends on clinical trials each year (up to a thousand times more than that!).</p><p><i><strong>REPEAT Initiative</strong></i></p><p>I can\u2019t remember how I first came across <a href=\"https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/profile/sebastian-schneeweiss/\"><u>Sebastian Schneeweiss</u></a> and his colleague <a href=\"https://www.drugepi.org/team/wang\"><u>Shirley Wang</u></a>, both of whom holding leading roles at Harvard Medical School and at the Division of Pharmacoepidemiology and Pharmacoeconomics at Brigham and Women's Hospital.</p><p>I <i>do</i> remember inviting them down to Houston to meet with the Arnolds in order to pitch their idea: they wanted to review studies using \u201cbig data\u201d in medicine (e.g., epidemiology, drug surveillance, etc.) in order to 1) assess the transparency of 250 of them, and 2) try to replicate 150 studies. Note: The replications here don\u2019t mean rerunning experiments, but rerunning code on the same databases as in the original study.</p><p>This sort of systematic study seemed important, given that in the 21<sup>st</sup> Century Cures Act, the federal government had promoted the idea that drugs could be approved based on \u201creal world evidence,\u201d meaning \u201cdata regarding the usage, or the potential benefits or risks, of a drug derived from sources other than randomized clinical trials\u201d (see section 3022 <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/34/text\"><u>here</u></a>).</p><p>How reliable is that \u201creal world evidence\u201d anyway? No one knew.</p><p>We ended up giving a <a href=\"https://www.arnoldventures.org/grants/the-brigham-and-women-s-hospital-inc-10\"><u>$2 million grant</u></a> to launch the <a href=\"https://www.repeatinitiative.org/\"><u>REPEAT Initiative</u></a> at Harvard, with REPEAT standing for \u201cReproducible Evidence: Practices to Enhance and Achieve Transparency.\u201d A <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-32310-3\"><u>2022 publication</u></a> from this project noted that it was the \u201clargest and most systematic evaluation of reproducibility and reporting-transparency for [real-world evidence] studies ever conducted.\u201d</p><p>The overall finding was that the replication \u201ceffect sizes were strongly correlated between the original publications and study reproductions in the same data sources,\u201d but that that there was room for improvement (since some findings couldn\u2019t be reproduced even with the same methods and data).</p><p>This overall finding is an understatement, of course. If a drug is approved to market to the US population, what we really care about is whether the original finding still applies to new data/people/etc. If we could do a broader replication project, I\u2019m fairly certain that we would find more discrepancies between what the FDA approved and what actually works in the real world.</p><p>The researchers at the REPEAT Initiative (Wang and Schneeweiss) since procured an award from FDA to use health claims databases to try to replicate key RCTs.&nbsp;Their <a href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2804067\"><u>initial results</u></a> show that a \u201chighly selected, nonrepresentative sample\u201d of \u201creal-world evidence studies can reach similar conclusions as RCTs when design and measurements can be closely emulated, but this may be difficult to achieve.\u201d They also note that \u201cemulation differences, chance, and residual confounding can contribute to divergence in results and are difficult to disentangle.\u201d</p><p>In other words, the political enthusiasm for \u201creal-world evidence\u201d as a substitute for rigorous RCTs (rather than a complement) is overly na\u00efve\u2014at least as it would be implemented, well, in the real world.</p><p><i><strong>Publication Standards at the journal Nature</strong></i></p><p>Around 2014, <a href=\"https://www.ed.ac.uk/profile/professor-malcolm-macleod\"><u>Malcolm McLeod</u></a>, a professor of Neurology and Translational Neuroscience at the University of Edinburgh (and one of the most hilariously droll people I\u2019ve ever met) wanted to evaluate <i>Nature</i>\u2019s new editorial requirements for research in the life sciences.</p><p>I gave him <a href=\"https://www.arnoldventures.org/grants/university-of-edinburgh-2\"><u>a grant of $82,859</u></a> to do so. He and his colleagues compared 394 articles in the <i>Nature</i> set of journals to 353 similar articles in other journals, including articles both before and after the change in <i>Nature</i>\u2019s standards. The team looked at the number of articles that satisfied four criteria (information on randomization, blinding, sample size, and exclusions).</p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8647608/\"><u>findings</u></a> were that in <i>Nature</i>-related articles, the number of articles that met all four criteria went from 0% to 16.4% after the change in guidelines, but the number of such articles in other journals stayed near zero over the whole timeframe.</p><p>In other words, a change in journal guidelines increased the number of articles that met basic quality standards, but there was still a long way to go. Thus, their findings encapsulated the entire open science movement: Some progress, but lots more to come.</p><p><i><strong>Computer Science</strong></i></p><p>In 2015, I made <a href=\"https://www.arnoldventures.org/grants/university-of-arizona-foundation-2\"><u>a grant of $357,468</u></a> to <a href=\"http://proebsting.cs.arizona.edu/\"><u>Todd Proebsting</u></a> and <a href=\"https://www.cs.arizona.edu/person/christian-collberg\"><u>Christian Collberg</u></a> at the University of Arizona to do a longitudinal study of how computer scientists share data and research artifacts. They published <a href=\"https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2812803\"><u>a study in 2016</u></a> (also <a href=\"https://sci-hub.ru/10.1145/2812803\"><u>here</u></a>) on \u201crepeatability in computer systems research,\u201d with the findings represented in this colored/numbered flow chart:</p><p><a href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F87a53164-c98c-46e2-9e9b-e3531f7aaae8_746x567.png\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F87a53164-c98c-46e2-9e9b-e3531f7aaae8_746x567.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F87a53164-c98c-46e2-9e9b-e3531f7aaae8_746x567.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F87a53164-c98c-46e2-9e9b-e3531f7aaae8_746x567.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F87a53164-c98c-46e2-9e9b-e3531f7aaae8_746x567.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F87a53164-c98c-46e2-9e9b-e3531f7aaae8_746x567.png 1456w\"></a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>They also produced <a href=\"http://www.findresearch.org/\"><u>this website</u></a> cataloguing 20,660 articles from 78,945 authors (at present) and the availability of code and data. To repeat myself, this seems like the sort of thing that NSF ought to support in perpetuity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><i><strong>Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation</strong></i></p><p>In 2015, I gave the Center for Open Science <a href=\"https://www.arnoldventures.org/grants/center-for-open-science-inc-16\"><u>a grant of $41,212</u></a> to work with another researcher to try to replicate one or more experiments using transcranial direct current stimulation, a popular but <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27008245/\"><u>controversial</u></a> treatment where replication seemed like it would turn up useful insights (as shown by <a href=\"https://munin.uit.no/handle/10037/25902\"><u>subsequent studies</u></a>). This grant was a failure: The outside researcher never completed the project. Not much more to say about this one.</p><h3><strong>II.&nbsp;</strong><i><strong>Make It Possible and Make It Easy</strong></i><strong>: software, databases, and other tools to help improve reproducibility</strong></h3><p>One of the most important ways to improve science (so I thought) was to provide better tools, software, etc., so that scientists would have more readily available ways to do good work. After all, one of the most common excuses for failing to share data/methods/code was that it was just too hard and time-consuming. If we could help remove that excuse, perhaps more scientists would engage in good practices.</p><p><i><strong>Open Science Framework</strong></i></p><p>A significant part of the funding for the Center for Open Science was always the development of the Open Science Framework software/website. To this day, COS\u2019s staff includes 15+ people who work on software and product development.</p><p>What was OSF? From the beginning, I saw it as a software platform that allowed scientists to create a wiki-style page for each research project, share with collaborators, track changes over time, and more. Along the way, the platform also enabled preregistration (by freezing in time the current status of a given project) and preprints (by allowing access to PDFs or other versions of articles). Indeed, its SocArXiv preprint service currently hosts over 13,000 papers as a free and open source alternative to SSRN (the Social Science Research Network), and OSF is home to <a href=\"https://osf.io/registries/discover\"><u>around 140,000 preregistrations</u></a>.</p><p>As other examples, OSF was recently listed as <a href=\"https://sharing.nih.gov/data-management-and-sharing-policy/sharing-scientific-data/generalist-repositories\"><u>one of the few data repositories that the NIH recommends</u></a> for complying with its new data-sharing policy. Among many other institutional partners, the Harvard Library recommends OSF to the Harvard community, and offers ways to link OSF to a Harvard account (see <a href=\"https://library.harvard.edu/services-tools/open-science-framework\"><u>here</u></a>).</p><p>I\u2019ll quote from <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BrianNosek/status/1564669780749160449\"><u>a Twitter thread</u></a> by Brian Nosek from last August on the occasion of OSF having 500,000 registered users:</p><blockquote><p>How much has open science accelerated?</p><p>OSF launched in 2012. In its first year, we had less than 400 users. In 2022, OSF averages 469 new registered users per day, every day.</p><p>OSF consumers don't need an account. More than 13M people have consumed OSF content so far in 2022.</p><p>Other daily averages for 2022 so far:</p><ul><li>202 new projects every day</li><li>9105 files posted every day</li><li>5964 files made publicly accessible every day</li><li>93 studies registered every day</li></ul></blockquote><p><i><strong>Vivli</strong></i></p><p>Clinical trials in medicine always seemed to me like the quintessential case where we ought to have the full evidence before us. Sure, if some trendy social psychology studies on power posing and the like were p-hacked, that would be troubling and we might end up buying the wrong book in an airport bookstore or being too credulous at a TED talk. But when medical trials were faked or p-hacked, cancer patients might end up spending thousands on a drug that didn\u2019t actually work or that even made things worse. The stakes seemed higher.</p><p>In the 2013-14 timeframe, I noticed that there were many efforts to share clinical trial data\u2014too many, in fact. The <a href=\"https://yoda.yale.edu/\"><u>Yale Open Data Alliance</u></a> was sharing data from Medtronic and J&amp;J trials; Duke <a href=\"https://dcri.org/our-work/analytics-and-data-science/data-sharing/bms-studies/\"><u>was sharing data</u></a> from Bristol; Pfizer had its own <a href=\"https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer_expands_clinical_trial_data_access_policy_and_launches_data_access_portal\"><u>Blue Button initiative</u></a>; GSK had set up <a href=\"https://clinicalstudydatarequest.com/\"><u>its own site</u></a> to share data from GSK and other companies; and there were more.</p><p>Sharing data is most useful if done on a <i>universal</i> basis where everyone can search, access, and reanalyze data no matter what the source. That wasn\u2019t occurring here. Companies and academia were all sharing clinical trial data in inconsistent ways across inconsistent websites. If someone wanted to reanalyze or do a meta-analysis on a category of drugs (say, antidepressant drugs from multiple companies), there was no way to do that.</p><p>Thus, I had the thought: What if there were a one-stop-shop for clinical trial data? A site that hosted data but also linked to and pulled in data from all the other sites, so that researchers interested in replication or meta-analysis could draw on data from everywhere? They would be far better able to do their work.</p><p>I asked around: Was anyone doing this? If not, why not? The answer was always: \u201cNo, but someone <i>should</i> do this!\u201d</p><p>I ended up giving a small grant to <a href=\"https://bioethics.hms.harvard.edu/faculty-staff/barbara-emily-bierer\"><u>Barbara Bierer</u></a> at Harvard (and Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital in Boston) at the <a href=\"https://mrctcenter.org/\"><u>Multi-Regional Clinical Trials Center at Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard</u></a> to have a conference on clinical trial data-sharing. The conference was well-attended, and I remember seeing folks like Deb Zarin, then the director of Clinicals.gov, and Mike Lauer, who was then at NHLBI and now is the Director of Extramural Research at NIH.</p><p>After that, I gave a <a href=\"https://www.arnoldventures.org/grants/the-brigham-and-women-s-hospital-inc-9\"><u>planning grant of $500,000</u></a> to Bierer and her colleagues to help create a clinical trial data-sharing platform, plus a <a href=\"https://www.arnoldventures.org/grants/vivli-inc\"><u>$2 million grant in 2017</u></a> to actually launch the platform. The result was <a href=\"https://vivli.org/\"><u>Vivli</u></a>. After a <a href=\"https://www.arnoldventures.org/grants/vivli-inc-2\"><u>$200k supplemental grant</u></a> in 2019, Vivli was on its own as a self-sufficient platform. As of 2023, Vivli shares data from 6,600+ clinical trials with over 3.6 million participants.</p><p>By those metrics, Vivli is by far the biggest repository for clinical trial data in the world. But not enough people request Vivli data. The last I heard, the number of data requests was far less than one per trial.</p><p>This leads to a disturbing thought about platforms and policies on data-sharing (for example, the NIH\u2019s new data-sharing rule that went into effect in January 2023). That is, why should we spend so much effort, money, and time on sharing data if hardly anyone else wants to request and reuse someone else\u2019s data in the first place? It\u2019s an existential question for folks who care about research quality\u2014what if we <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3c_pJ_CLJQ\"><u>built it and no one came</u></a>?</p><p>That said, we could improve both PhD education and the reuse of data in one fell swoop: If you\u2019re doing a PhD in anything like biostatistics, epidemiology, etc., you should have to pick a trial or publication, download the data from a place like Vivli or various NIH repositories, and try to replicate the analysis (preferably exploring additional ideas as well).</p><p>Who knows what would happen\u2014perhaps a number of studies would stand up, but others wouldn\u2019t (as seen in <a href=\"https://psyarxiv.com/dpyn6?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email\"><u>a similar psychology project</u></a>). In any event, the number of replications would be considerable, and it would be valuable training for the doctoral students. Two birds, one stone.</p><p><i><strong>Declare Design</strong></i></p><p>One key problem for high-quality research is that while there are many innovations as to experimental design, fixed effects, difference-in-differences, etc., there often isn\u2019t a good way to do analyze these designs ahead of time. What will be your statistical power? The possible effects of sampling bias? The expected root mean squared error? The robustness across multiple tests? For these and many other questions, there might not be any simple numerical solution.</p><p>Enter <a href=\"https://declaredesign.org/\"><u>DeclareDesign</u></a>. The idea behind DeclareDesign is that you \u201cdeclare\u201d in advance the \u201cdesign\u201d of your study, and then the program does simulations that help you get a handle on how that study design will work out.</p><p>The folks behind DeclareDesign were all political scientists, whom I met through an introduction from <a href=\"https://polisci.columbia.edu/content/donald-p-green\"><u>Don Green</u></a> around 2015 or so:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://graemeblair.com/\"><u>Graeme Blair</u></a>, Associate Professor of Political Science at UCLA.</li><li><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/jasper-jack-cooper/\"><u>Jasper Cooper</u></a>, then in the middle of a PhD in political science at Columbia, and now a Portfolio Lead at the Office of Evaluation Sciences at the General Services Administration.</li><li><a href=\"https://alexandercoppock.com/\"><u>Alexander Coppock</u></a>, Associate Professor of Political Science at Yale.</li><li><a href=\"https://macartan.github.io/\"><u>Macartan Humphreys</u></a>, at the time a Professor of Political Science at Columbia, and currently director of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.wzb.eu/en/research/political-economy-of-development/institutions-and-political-inequality\"><u>Institutions and Political Inequality group</u></a>&nbsp;at the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://wzb.eu/en\"><u>WZB Berlin Social Science Center</u></a>&nbsp;and honorary professor of social sciences at Humboldt University.</li></ul><p>In 2016, they put out <a href=\"https://osf.io/preprints/metaarxiv/m6ws3/\"><u>the first draft</u></a> of an article on their idea. It was <a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-political-science-review/article/declaring-and-diagnosing-research-designs/3CB0C0BB0810AEF8FF65446B3E2E4926\"><u>eventually published</u></a> in the American Political Science Review in 2019. As they write:</p><p>Formally declaring research designs as objects in the manner we describe here brings, we hope, four benefits. It can facilitate the diagnosis of designs in terms of their ability to answer the questions we want answered under specified conditions; it can assist in the improvement of research designs through comparison with alternatives; it can enhance research transparency by making design choices explicit; and it can provide strategies to assist principled replication and reanalysis of published research.</p><p>I gave them <a href=\"https://www.arnoldventures.org/grants/the-regents-of-the-university-of-california-los-angeles-12\"><u>a grant of $447,572</u></a> in 2016 to help build out their software, which is primarily written in R, but the grant was also intended to help them build a web interface that didn\u2019t require any coding ability (<a href=\"https://declaredesign.org/blog/now-there-is-a-web-interface-for-declaring-and-diagnosing-research-designs.html\"><u>DDWizard</u></a>, released in 2020).</p><p>The software got a positive reception from social scientists across different disciplines. A flavor of the reactions:</p><ul><li>A major university professor once wrote to me DeclareDesign was an \"incredible contribution to academic social science research and to policy evaluation.\"</li><li>A Dartmouth professor <a href=\"https://twitter.com/yangyang_zhou/status/1039923770465677312\"><u>posted on Twitter</u></a> that \u201cit\u2019s an amazing resource by super smart people for research design and thinking through our theories and assumptions.\u201d</li><li>A political scientist at Washington University-St. Louis <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Jacob_Montg/status/1281594340570275840\"><u>wrote</u></a>: \u201cIt is remarkable how many methods questions I answer these days just by recommending DeclareDesign.&nbsp; Such an awesome piece of software.\u201d</li><li>An Oxford professor of neuropsychology <a href=\"https://twitter.com/deevybee/status/1438397156675702785\"><u>wrote</u></a>: \u201cIt's complex and difficult at first, but it does a fantastic job of using simulations not just to estimate power, but also to evaluate a research design in terms of other things, like bias or cost.\u201d</li></ul><p>I do think that this was a good investment; beyond Twitter anecdotes, DeclareDesign won the 2019 \u201c<a href=\"https://polmeth.org/statistical-software-award\"><u>Best Statistical Software Award</u></a>\u201d from the Society for Political Methodology. Blair, Coppock and Humphreys are about to publish a book on the whole approach: <a href=\"https://book.declaredesign.org/\"><u>Research Design in the Social Sciences</u></a>.

Long story short, I was able to give them <a href=\"https://www.arnoldventures.org/grants/the-board-of-trustees-of-the-leland-stanford-junior-university-23\"><u>a grant of $3.6 million in 2015</u></a> to launch the Stanford Center for Reproducible Neuroscience. The intent was to promote data sharing in neuroscience, as well as higher data quality standards for a field that had been plagued by criticisms for quite some time (see <a href=\"https://law.stanford.edu/2009/09/18/what-a-dead-salmon-reminds-us-about-fmri-analysis/\"><u>the infamous 2009 paper</u></a> involving a brain scan of dead fish). The critiques continue to this day (see <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-04492-9\"><u>a recent </u><i><u>Nature</u></i><u> study</u></a> showing that most brain-wide association studies are vastly underpowered).</p><p>The project has been quite successful in the years since. First, the <a href=\"https://openneuro.org/\"><u>OpenNeuro archive</u></a> that was the main focus of the project was launched in 2017. It has grown consistently since then, and now hosts brain imaging data from more than 33,000 individuals and 872 different datasets. It is one of the official data archives of the BRAIN Initiative, and just received its second five-year round of NIH funding (which will go from 2023-2028).</p><p>Second, the <a href=\"https://bids.neuroimaging.io/\"><u>Brain Imaging Data Structure (or BIDS) standard</u></a> that was developed to support data organization for OpenNeuro has been remarkably successful.&nbsp; When Chris Gorgolewski left academia in 2019, it became a community project with an elected Steering Group and well over 100 contributors to date. One of the ideas that Chris developed was the \"BIDS App\" which is a containerized application that processes a BIDS dataset. One of these, <a href=\"https://fmriprep.org/en/stable/\"><u>fMRIPrep</u></a>, has been widely used\u2014according to Poldrack, there had been over 4,000 successful runs of the software per week over the last 6 months.</p><p>Indeed, a draft article on the history of the BIDS standard\u2014which is now expected practice in neuroscience\u2014includes this sentence: \u201cThe birth of BIDS can be traced back ultimately to a Twitter post by Russ Poldrack on October 17, 2014.\u201d The paragraph then discusses the interaction between me and Russ (shown above).</p><p>This story shows not just the power of Twitter, but the power of publicly sharing information and ideas about what you\u2019re working on\u2014you never know who will read it, and start a conversation that leads to something like whole new set of data standards for neuroscience.&nbsp;</p><p><i><strong>Stealth Software Technologies</strong></i></p><p>My friend Danny Goroff (usually at the Sloan Foundation, but currently at the White House) introduced me to the topic of privacy-preserving computation, such as secure multi-party computation or fully homomorphic encryption. It would take too long to explain here, but there are ways that you could write a regression equation and compute it on data that remains entirely private to you the entire time, and there are ways to match and merge data from sources that keep their data private the whole time.</p><p>The possibilities seemed endless. One of the biggest obstacles to evidence-based policy is how hard it is to access private data on sensitive issues (health, criminal justice, etc.), let alone match and merge that data with other sources (e.g., income or schooling) so that you can research how housing/schooling affects health or criminal outcomes.</p><p>It seemed like every researcher working in these areas had to spend way too much time and money on negotiating relationships with individual state/federal agencies and then figuring out the legalities of data access. If there was a way to do all of this computation while keeping the underlying data private the entire time, it might be a shortcut around many of the legal obstacles to working with highly private data.</p><p>I spent a year (in my spare time) reading books on computation and encryption before I finally felt comfortable pitching a grant to the Arnolds on this topic. I also talked to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craig_Gentry_(computer_scientist)\"><u>Craig Gentry</u></a>, who invented fully homomorphic encryption in his graduate dissertation (and then went to work for IBM).</p><p>I ended up making <a href=\"https://www.arnoldventures.org/grants/stealth-software-technologies-commercial-inc-2\"><u>a grant of $1,840,267</u></a> to <a href=\"https://www.stealthsoftwareinc.com/\"><u>Stealth Software Technologies</u></a>, a company formed by <a href=\"http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~rafail/\"><u>Rafail Ostrovsky of UCLA</u></a> (one of the giants in the field) and <a href=\"https://www.gc.cuny.edu/people/william-skeith\"><u>Wes Skeith</u></a>. Ostrovsky had primarily been funded by DARPA. The grant included working with ICPSR, the Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research, one of the largest data repositories in the world for social science data. Our goal was to find ways to do social science research that combined data from two different sources (e.g., an education agency and a health agency) while keeping data provably private the entire time.</p><p>The result was an open-source set of software (available <a href=\"https://github.com/stealthsoftwareinc/safrn\"><u>here</u></a>), although it still needs more explanation, marketing, and use. The team has given <a href=\"https://csrc.nist.gov/Events/2021/stppa2\"><u>talks at NIST</u></a> on secure computation, and has worked with Senator Ron Wyden on proposing the <a href=\"https://www.wyden.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Secure%20Research%20Data%20Network%20(SRDN)%20One-Pager.pdf\"><u>Secure Research Data Network Act</u></a>, which would authorize a multi-million pilot at NSF using secure multi-computation to help create much more \u201cresearch that could support smart, evidence-based policymaking.\u201d</p><p>The same group (Stealth Software Technologies and George Alter) have also engaged in a DARPA-funded collaboration with the state of Virginia to produce a working version of the cryptographic software that will be used on a regular basis. The goal in the Virginia government is to get more agency participation in sharing private data and/or improving the capabilities of the Virginia Longitudinal Data System.</p><h3><strong>III.&nbsp; </strong><i><strong>Make It Normative</strong></i></h3><p><i><strong>Journalists/Websites</strong></i></p><p>As much as everyone says that \u201cscience is self-correcting,\u201d an ironic downside of the academic incentive system is that there are essentially no rewards for actively calling out problems in a given field (as my friend Simine Vazire and her spouse Alex Holcombe <a href=\"https://psyarxiv.com/kgqzt/\"><u>have written</u></a>). There are no tenure-track positions in \u201cnoticing replicability issues with other people\u2019s research,\u201d no academic departments devoted to replication or the discovery of academic fraud, and very few government grants (if any). On top of that, as we\u2019ve seen above, people who devote hundreds or thousands of hours to replication or uncovering fraud often find themselves with no academic job while being threatened with lawsuits.</p><p>It is a thankless task. \u201cScience is self-correcting\u201d\u2014sure, if you don\u2019t mind being an outcast.</p><p>Yet public correction is necessary. Otherwise, individual scientists or even entire academic fields can coast for years or decades without being held to account. Public scrutiny can create pressure to improve research standards, as has been seen in fields such as medicine and psychology. That\u2019s why one line of Arnold funding was devoted to supporting websites and journalists that called out research problems.</p><p><i><strong>Retraction Watch</strong></i></p><p>One oddity in scholarly communication is that even when articles are retracted, other scholars keep citing them. Historically, there just wasn\u2019t a good way to let everyone know, \u201cStop citing this piece, except as an example of retracted work.\u201d But now that we have the Internet, that isn\u2019t really an excuse.</p><p>As it turns out, journal websites often don\u2019t highlight the fact that an article was retracted. Thus, <a href=\"https://direct.mit.edu/qss/article/2/4/1144/107356/Continued-use-of-retracted-papers-Temporal-trends\"><u>one article</u></a> that reviewed papers from 1960-2020 found that \u201cretraction did not change the way the retracted papers were cited,\u201d and only 5.4% of the citations even bothered to acknowledge the retraction. There are many more articles on this unfortunate phenomenon (see <a href=\"https://www.science.org/content/article/many-scientists-citing-two-scandalous-covid-19-papers-ignore-their-retractions\"><u>here</u></a> and <a href=\"https://massivesci.com/articles/science-retractions-publications-mistakes-month/\"><u>here</u></a>).</p><p>Retraction Watch is one of the most successful journalistic outlets focused on problematic research since its launch in 2010 by Ivan Oransky and Adam Marcus.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://retractionwatch.com/meet-the-retraction-watch-staff/about-adam-marcus/\"><u>Marcus</u></a>, the editorial director for primary care at&nbsp;<i>Medscape</i>, is the former managing editor of&nbsp;<i>Gastroenterology &amp; Endoscopy News</i>, and has done a lot of freelance science journalism.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://retractionwatch.com/meet-the-retraction-watch-staff/about/\"><u>Oransky</u></a>, the editor in chief of&nbsp;<i>Spectrum</i>, a publication about autism research, is also a Distinguished Writer In Residence at New York University\u2019s Carter Journalism Institute, and has previously held leadership positions at&nbsp;<i>Medscape</i>,&nbsp;<i>Reuters Health</i>,&nbsp;<i>Scientific American</i>, and&nbsp;<i>The Scientist</i>. It has published thousands of blog posts (or articles) on problematic research.</p><p>In 2014, John Arnold emailed me about <a href=\"https://retractionwatch.com/2014/03/17/dear-retraction-watch-readers-we-want-to-grow-heres-how-you-can-help/\"><u>this Retraction Watch post</u></a> asking for donations. I looked into it, and eventually Retraction Watch pitched me on a database of retractions in the scholarly literature in order to help scholars keep track of what <i>not</i> to cite. In 2015, we awarded Retraction Watch a <a href=\"https://www.arnoldventures.org/grants/the-center-for-scientific-integrity-inc\"><u>grant of $280,926</u></a> to <a href=\"https://www.cos.io/about/news/center-open-science-and-center-scientific-integrity-announce-partnership\"><u>partner with the Center for Open Science</u></a> on that effort. The database is available <a href=\"http://retractiondatabase.org/RetractionSearch.aspx?\"><u>here</u></a>, and as a <a href=\"https://retractionwatch.com/2023/07/01/weekend-reads-a-professor-who-plagiarized-his-students-how-many-postgrads-in-china-think-its-ok-to-fake-data-fighting-fraud/\"><u>recent post</u></a> stated:</p><blockquote><p>Our list of retracted or withdrawn COVID-19 papers is&nbsp;<a href=\"http://retractionwatch.com/retracted-coronavirus-covid-19-papers/\"><u>up to more than 300</u></a>. There are now&nbsp;<a href=\"http://retractiondatabase.org/\"><u>41,000 retractions in our database</u></a>&nbsp;\u2014 which powers retraction alerts in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/RetractionWatch/status/1458421915761221643\"><u>EndNote</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://mailchi.mp/thirdiron/jan2021_newsletter-1414009\"><u>LibKey</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.papersapp.com/blog-papers-announces-expanded-retraction-support/\"><u>Papers</u></a>, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.zotero.org/blog/retracted-item-notifications/\"><u>Zotero</u></a>. The Retraction Watch Hijacked Journal Checker&nbsp;<a href=\"https://retractionwatch.com/the-retraction-watch-hijacked-journal-checker/\"><u>now contains 200 titles</u></a>.

Indeed, a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0048733323000999\"><u>recent paper</u></a>&nbsp;found the following: \"reporting retractions on RW significantly reduced post-retraction citations of non-swiftly retracted articles in biomedical sciences.\"</p><p>Even by 2018, there were many interesting findings from this database, as documented in <a href=\"https://www.science.org/content/article/what-massive-database-retracted-papers-reveals-about-science-publishing-s-death-penalty\"><u>a </u><i><u>Science</u></i><u> article</u></a>. The <i>Science</i> article also quotes a notable metascience scholar (Hilda Bastian):</p><blockquote><p>Such discussions underscore how far the dialogue around retractions has advanced since those disturbing headlines from nearly a decade ago. And although the Retraction Watch database has brought new data to the discussions, it also serves as a reminder of how much researchers still don't understand about the prevalence, causes, and impacts of retractions. Data gaps mean \"you have to take the entire literature [on retractions] with a grain of salt,\" Bastian says. \"Nobody knows what all the retracted articles are. The publishers don't make that easy.\"</p><p>Bastian is incredulous that Oransky's and Marcus's \"passion project\" is, so far, the most comprehensive source of information about a key issue in scientific publishing. A database of retractions \"is a really serious and necessary piece of infrastructure,\" she says. But the lack of long-term funding for such efforts means that infrastructure is \"fragile, and it shouldn't be.\"</p></blockquote><p>I obviously agree. One of my perpetual frustrations was that even though NIH and NSF were spending many times Arnold\u2019s entire endowment every single year, comparatively little is spent on infrastructure or metascience efforts that would be an enormous public good. <strong>Instead, we at Arnold were constantly in the position of awarding $300k to a project that, in any rational system, would be a no-brainer for NIH or NSF to support at $1 or $2 million a year forever.</strong></p><p><i><strong>PubPeer</strong></i></p><p>PubPeer is a discussion board that was launched in 2012 as a way for anonymous whistleblowers to point out flaws or fraud in scientific research. It has since become a focal point for such discussions. While anonymous discussion boards can be fraught with difficulties themselves (i.e., people who just want to harass someone else, or throw out baseless accusations), PubPeer seemed to take a responsible approach\u2014it <a href=\"https://pubpeer.com/static/faq\"><u>requires</u></a> that comments be based on \u201cpublicly verifiable information\u201d and that they not include \u201callegations of misconduct.\u201d Are there occasions where an anonymous commenter might have valuable inside information about misconduct? For sure. But valid comments could be lost in a swarm of trolls, saboteurs, etc. PubPeer decided to focus only on verifiable problems with scientific data.</p><p>I initially gave PubPeer <a href=\"https://www.arnoldventures.org/grants/pubpeer-foundation\"><u>a grant of $412,800</u></a> in 2016 as general operating support; this was followed by a $150,000 <a href=\"https://www.arnoldventures.org/grants/pubpeer-foundation-2\"><u>general operating grant</u></a> in 2019. The 2016 grant <a href=\"https://retractionwatch.com/2017/06/15/meet-pubpeer-2-0-new-version-post-publication-peer-review-site-launches-today/\"><u>enabled PubPeer</u></a> to \u201chire a very talented new programmer to work on the site full-time and completely rewrite it to make it easier to add some of the ideas we have for new features in the future.\u201d In particular, a previous lawsuit had <a href=\"https://retractionwatch.com/2015/03/20/judge-tells-pubpeer-to-hand-over-information-about-anonymous-commenter-site-weighing-options/\"><u>tried to order PubPeer</u></a> to provide information about commenters who had <a href=\"https://retractionwatch.com/2014/10/26/scientist-sues-pubpeer-commenters-subpoenas-site-for-names/\"><u>allegedly cost a professor a job</u></a> due to research irregularities (or possible fraud). PubPeer used our funding to revamp so as to be completely unable \u201cto reveal any user information if we receive another subpoena or if the site is hacked.\u201d As well, thanks to Laura Arnold\u2019s membership on the ACLU\u2019s national board, I was able to introduce PubPeer to folks at the ACLU <a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/cases/sarkar-v-doe-pubpeer-subpoena-challenge#legal-documents\"><u>who helped defend the lawsuit</u></a>.</p><p>While it can often be difficult to know the counterfactual in philanthropy (\u201cwould the same good work have happened anyway?), I\u2019m fairly confident in this case that without our grant and the introduction to the ACLU, PubPeer would likely have been forced to shut down.</p><p>I thought, and still think, that this sort of outlet is enormously useful. Just last year, a <a href=\"https://www.science.org/content/article/potential-fabrication-research-images-threatens-key-theory-alzheimers-disease\"><u>major scandal in Alzheimer\u2019s research</u></a> was first exposed by commenters on PubPeer\u2014not by grant peer review, journal peer review, or by the NIH grant reports that had been submitted over a decade before. And as I say throughout, it seems like a no-brainer for NIH or NSF to support this sort of effort with $1-2 million a year indefinitely. We have very few ways of collecting whistleblower information about fraud or other research problems that many people (particularly younger scientists) might be reluctant to bring up otherwise.&nbsp;</p><p><i><strong>HealthNewsReview</strong></i></p><p>HealthNewsReview (now defunct) was a website run by Gary Schwitzer, a former medical correspondent for CNN and journalism professor at the University of Minnesota. The focus was providing regular, structured critiques of health/science journalism. In 2008, Ben Goldacre <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/jun/21/2\"><u>had written about a HealthNewsReview study</u></a> showing that out of 500 health articles in the United States, <a href=\"https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.0050095\"><u>only 35%</u></a> had competently \u201cdiscussed the study methodology and the quality of the evidence.\u201d The site had come up with 10 criteria for responsible journalism about health/science studies, such as whether the story discusses costs, quantifies benefits in meaningful terms, explains possible harms, compares to existing alternatives, looks for independence and conflicts of interest, reviews the study\u2019s methodology and evidentiary quality, and more.</p><p>The site seemed to be widely respected among health journalists, but had run out of funding. I thought their efforts were important and worth reviving. As a result, in 2014, I gave a <a href=\"https://www.arnoldventures.org/grants/regents-of-the-university-of-minnesota-11\"><u>$1.24 million grant</u></a> to the University of Minnesota for Gary Schwitzer\u2019s efforts at HealthNewsReview, and this was followed by a <a href=\"https://www.arnoldventures.org/grants/regents-of-the-university-of-minnesota-4\"><u>$1.6 million grant in 2016</u></a>.</p><p>One of their most widely-known successes was the case of the \u201cchocolate milk, concussion\u201d story. In late 2015, the University of Maryland put out a <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20160215162357/https:/www.mtech.umd.edu/news/press_releases/releases/5QF/concussions\"><u>press release</u></a> claiming that chocolate milk \u201chelped high school football players improve their cognitive and motor function over the course of a season, even after experiencing concussions.\u201d A journalist who worked for HealthNewsReview started asking questions, such as \u201cwhere is the study in question?\u201d</p><p>Boy, was he in for a surprise when the Univ. of Maryland <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20160325030716/http:/www.healthnewsreview.org/2016/01/why-wont-the-university-of-maryland-talk-about-the-chocolate-milkconcussion-study-it-was-so-eager-to-promote/\"><u>called him back</u></a>:</p><blockquote><p>The next morning I received a call from the MIPS news office contact listed on the news release, Eric Schurr. What I heard astounded me. I couldn\u2019t find any journal article because there wasn\u2019t one. Not only wasn\u2019t this study published, it might never be submitted for publication. There wasn\u2019t even an unpublished report they could send me.</p></blockquote><p>The story became a <a href=\"https://www.thecut.com/2016/01/chocolate-milk-concussion-scandal.html\"><u>major scandal</u></a> for the University of Maryland. The university did its own <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20160418111821/https:/umdrightnow.umd.edu/sites/umdrightnow.umd.edu/files/16-03-24-report-final.pdf\"><u>internal review</u></a>, which Schwitzer then <a href=\"https://www.kqed.org/futureofyou/162446/is-health-journalism-doing-more-harm-than-good\"><u>characterized</u></a> as a \u201cscathing self-reflection, in which they admitted the research was schlocky, conflicts of interests that should have been reported, and no clear lines of authority for who approved news releases.\u201d</p><p>As <a href=\"https://ksj.mit.edu/tracker-archive/gary-schwitzer-and-healthnewsreview-org-are-baaaaack/\"><u>one journalist wrote in 2014</u></a> after my grant: \u201cHealthNewsReview won numerous awards, and, more importantly, kept many medical reporters on their toes\u2013including me. . . . It\u2019s great to see Schwitzer back. Although there is a downside\u2013I, and many of my colleagues, will once again be looking nervously over our shoulders. But that\u2019s not so bad\u2013our reporting will surely be the better for it.\u201d</p><p>By the end of their run, they had analyzed 2,616 news stories and 606 PR news releases. They had also published 2,946 blog posts, 50 podcasts, and a fairly extensive toolkit of resources for journalists and the general public. But HealthNewsReview is no more. Even the website registration has expired. I still wish that a funder like NIH would support efforts like HealthNewsReview to improve how science is communicated to the public.</p><p><i><strong>Standards/Ratings as to Research Quality and Transparency</strong></i></p><p>One of the most replicable features of human beings is our incessant need to compete with each other, even as to measures that we know are irrational. There is a large psychology literature on how people can be drawn into mindless competition with others, even if it\u2019s only a room divided randomly into Group A and Group B, or <a href=\"https://www.csusb.edu/inside/article/449756/creator-famous-blue-eyes-brown-eyes-exercise-jane-elliott-returns-csusb\"><u>people with blue eyes versus people with brown eyes</u></a>. More relevant here, universities compete tooth and nail to rise in the <i>US News</i> rankings, even though they all know that the rankings depend on fairly arbitrary factors.</p><p>Can we harness that universal human drive for a good purpose? Can we find ways to measure and rank scientific publications on a variety of metrics that relate to good science, and then watch people try to maximize those metrics rather than just maximizing citations?</p><p>Maybe so. I still have mixed feelings about this line of work (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart%27s_law\"><u>Goodhart\u2019s law</u></a>, and all that), and I wish we could set up some carefully targeted experiments that would show the effects (good or ill) of such interventions.</p><p>As it was, I funded the following efforts:</p><p><i><strong>TOP Guidelines</strong></i></p><p>The TOP (Transparency and Openness Promotion) Guidelines started out as an idea that Marcia McNutt and I kicked around the first time we met in person (we had emailed previously). It was during a break at an <a href=\"https://www.nsf.gov/sbe/AC_Materials/SBE_Robust_and_Reliable_Research_Report.pdf\"><u>NSF workshop on scientific reproducibility in February 2014</u></a>. Marcia was then the editor of <i>Science </i>(she has since become the first female president of the National Academies); she said that maybe we could fund some workshops on the standards for scientific publication, and I enthusiastically agreed.</p><p>Brian Nosek happened to walk up to say hello, and joined in what was now a 3-person conversation. We all started brainstorming on how we could bring together prominent scholars and journal editors from multiple fields in order to get some consensus on improved standards.</p><p>After that conversation, I quickly got the Arnolds to approve a <a href=\"https://www.arnoldventures.org/grants/american-association-for-the-advancement-of-science-3\"><u>$100k grant</u></a> to AAAS (the American Association for the Advancement of Science, which publishes <i>Science</i>). A side comment on philanthropy: That was one of the highest impact grants I ever made, and with the least effort to boot\u2014I sent a brief email, and the grant was approved in under 45 minutes. Hardly anyone in philanthropy works with that level of dexterity, and the philanthropic sector should put more thought into this issue.</p><p>Anyway, with the $100k in hand, AAAS worked with the Center for Open Science to host workshops on developing new and better standards for scientific publication, such as preregistration, sharing methods, sharing data, sharing code, and more. As to each standard of behavior, there would be multiple levels as to which a journal or funder could land\u2014not mentioning it at all, mentioning it, favoring it, or mandating it.</p><p>We held the first workshop in 2014 at the Center for Open Science\u2019s headquarters in Charlottesville, Virginia. Along with the other organizers, I put in much work figuring out who to invite.</p><p>We ended up with folks from many disciplines, which had its pros and cons. I particularly remember that someone commented afterwards that they had never seen someone interrupt to object to the <i>title slide</i> of a presentation (it was my friend Josh Angrist of MIT, also a substantial grantee, and someone who later won the Nobel in Economics\u2014Josh is brilliant but takes no prisoners, and well, economists act differently in seminars than psychological researchers).</p><p>The first workshop was a success by all measures, and we all worked over the next few months to co-publish a statement in <i>Science</i>: <a href=\"https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aab2374\"><u>Promoting an Open Research Culture</u></a>. The resulting TOP Guidelines are a set of eight standards that each have three different levels of rigor. For example, one standard is about preregistration\u2014level one of the TOP Guidelines involves merely stating whether preregistration happened at all, level two allows the journal access to the preregistration during peer review, and level three is that preregistration is required before publication. The same sort of differential levels can be seen for the other TOP standards, such as replication and data sharing.</p><p>By now, more than 5,000 journals, publishers, foundations, and other organizations have at least endorsed the TOP Guidelines. <i>Science</i> itself later adopted the guidelines at varying levels for <a href=\"https://www.science.org/content/page/science-journals-editorial-policies\"><u>its own publication practices</u></a>. The TOP Guidelines are easily the most widely-adopted publication guidelines in the world.</p><p>That said, a lot of work remains to be done. A follow-up initiative that I supported (<a href=\"https://topfactor.org/\"><u>TOP Factor</u></a>) evaluates journal policies to see whether they actually comport with the TOP Guidelines. Many don\u2019t comply that well, even if they endorsed the Guidelines at an earlier point.</p><p>Which goes to show one of the chief challenges for reproducibility: It is far too easy to gain points by \u201cendorsing\u201d an idea or a particular set of standards, even if one doesn\u2019t actually comply with or enforce those standards when push comes to shove. We need better ways of tracking compliance and behavior so that we\u2019re not fooled by anyone who is engaging in \u201cperformative reproducibility\u201d (to use a term from <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-01824-z\"><u>a piece</u></a> that <i>Nature</i> solicited from me in 2021).</p><p><i><strong>Good Pharma Scorecard</strong></i></p><p>A recurring question as to pharmaceutical companies is whether they correctly and timely report data on the effects and side effects of drugs and other treatments. If not, was there a way to hold them accountable in the public eye?</p><p>I\u2019ll never forget the first time I met Jennifer (Jen) Miller in 2013, who was then an assistant professor at the New York University School of Medicine. She reached out to me by email, and I agreed to meet for lunch. We went to a <a href=\"https://www.whiteoak-houston.com/'\"><u>restaurant</u></a> that was walking distance to the Arnold Foundation\u2019s offices. I ended up spending 2 hours there as she walked me through various slides and data on her laptop, all about how pharma companies reported on the results of their clinical trials. She argued that a rating system would incentivize these companies to be better behaved.</p><p>I thought there was something to this, but I wanted confirmation. So I called up Rob Califf (who was then at Duke, and who has since been the FDA Commissioner twice over). Califf had worked with Miller, and I wanted his opinion. He told me that Jen Miller was definitely worth funding.</p><p>In 2015, I ended up making a <a href=\"https://www.arnoldventures.org/grants/bioethics-international-inc\"><u>$4 million grant</u></a> to Miller\u2019s Good Pharma Scorecard. &nbsp;The basic idea was to measure and rate pharmaceutical companies on their practices as to transparency, data sharing, clinical trial design, accessibility, and more. With a public ranking, they would be incentivized to improve their practices.</p><p>You might think that this idea is na\u00efve, and that pharma companies only care about the bottom line. Maybe so, but I went to one of the Good Pharma Scorecard meetings in New York, and many top pharma executives were in attendance\u2014it was obvious from their comments (and just from their presence) that they deeply cared about how their company was rated as to transparency and quality of research. To be sure, they cared about whether they would be downgraded on some metric, and how that metric was applied or defined. If they could have gamed that metric, they probably would have. <i>But the point is that they cared</i>. Even if it had been just Miller and her team of investigators from Yale School of Medicine and Stanford Law School who say so, companies cared about their public ranking. It was fascinating to observe this dynamic in action.</p><p>Since the original grant, Jen Miller moved from NYU to the Yale School of Medicine, where she is an <a href=\"https://medicine.yale.edu/profile/jennifer-e-miller/\"><u>associate professor</u></a>. As a result of her efforts, transparency and data sharing practices have measurably improved year after year, with 50% of large companies <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31292127/\"><u>improving their data sharing practices</u></a> within 30 days of getting a low score from Bioethics International.</p><p>Based on this evidence of impact, she expanded the Good Pharma Scorecard\u2019s scope to include a ranking on companies\u2019 fair inclusion of women, older adults and racial and ethnic minorities in clinical research. The problem here is that we often test new medicines and vaccines in patients who are healthier, younger and more likely to identify as white and male than real world patients.</p><p>The FDA Oncology Center for Excellence awarded her <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/science-research/advancing-regulatory-science/positive-deviance-approach-representing-women-older-adults-and-patients-identifying-racial-and\"><u>a grant</u></a> to expand her work. She is conducting a positive deviance study, which involves identifying pharmaceutical companies demonstrating exceptionally high performance on specific Good Pharma Scorecard measures, in this case adequate representation of older adults, women, Asian, Black or Latino patients in trials supporting new cancer therapeutics, and then conducting qualitative research to understand how these leaders achieved their top performance. This allows for the identification of practices, strategies, and factors shared by positive deviants (aka leaders), allowing them to achieve top performance. &nbsp;</p><p>The Scorecard continues to grow in impact and visibility. Companies cite their scores and badges in their annual reports, CEO letters, and human rights due diligence, when they score well.&nbsp;Miller partnered with Deloitte last year to host the annual conference on the Scorecard\u2019s accountability metrics, and will host this year\u2019s meeting with E&amp;Y on 9/15, which is even better attended now than the event I first attended many years ago. Further, the annual meeting includes a growing number of socially responsible and impact investors, who can be further levers for change and incentivize adoption of the scorecard measures. &nbsp;Scientific American is the <a href=\"https://medicine.yale.edu/news-article/a-dose-of-good-medicine/\"><u>Scorecard\u2019s media partner</u></a>, helping elevate its visibility to their audience of over 8million.</p><p><i><strong>Rating Social Programs Funded by the Federal Government</strong></i></p><p>The U.S. government spends many billions of dollars every year on social programs or interventions that are intended to prevent teen pregnancy, prevent drug abuse, improve education, reduce crime, and much more. Many of these programs don\u2019t actually work very well, if at all. Yet there were many websites purporting to list and rate programs on their efficacy\u2014the <a href=\"https://ies.ed.gov/ncee/wwc/\"><u>What Works Clearinghouse</u></a>, <a href=\"https://crimesolutions.ojp.gov/\"><u>CrimeSolutions.gov</u></a>, and <a href=\"https://research2policy.org/clearinghouses-and-evidence-based-resources/\"><u>many more</u></a>.</p><p>In the past, these evidence clearinghouses usually included barebones measures of research quality (such as \u201cis it an RCT?\u201d) but not more nuanced measures (such as, \u201cwas the RCT preregistered?\u201d). I made <a href=\"https://www.arnoldventures.org/grants/indiana-university-6\"><u>a grant of $238,975</u></a> to Sean Grant and Evan Mayo-Wilson in order to look at how to improve the way federal agencies rate the evidence base for social programs.</p><p>For a relatively small grant, I think the impact was high. At the outset, check out <a href=\"https://www.trustinitiative.org/\"><u>their overall website</u></a> \u201cTransparency of Research Underpinning Social Intervention Tiers,\u201d or TRUST. They have been successful in promoting research transparency in the social intervention evidence ecosystem. A few examples:</p><ul><li>The TOP Guidelines are now mentioned in federal clearinghouse guidelines (<a href=\"https://homvee.acf.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/2020-12/HomVEE_Reporting_Guide.pdf\"><u>e.g., see Table 5</u></a>), as well as by <a href=\"https://www.sree.org/open-science-requirements\"><u>journals</u></a> that supply evidence on intervention effectiveness to federal clearinghouses.</li><li>Research societies active in this ecosystem have created special interest groups on open science (e.g,.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.preventionresearch.org/2023-annual-meeting/call-for-special-interest-groups-sigs/\"><u>the Society for Prevention Research</u></a>, or the &nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sree.org/research-transparency\"><u>Society for Research on Educational Effectiveness</u></a>).</li><li>The grantees have led revisions to the TOP Guidelines based on TRUST Initiative activities: Sean is the chair and Evan is a member of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cos.io/initiatives/top-guidelines\"><u>TOP Advisory Board</u></a> (I\u2019m a member as well).</li><li>Along with Lauren Supplee, they published <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11121-021-01284-x\"><u>an article</u></a> reviewing evidentiary standards at 10 federal clearinghouses, and providing recommendations for how to improve. They have published a number of other articles available <a href=\"https://www.trustinitiative.org/resources\"><u>here</u></a>.</li></ul><p>My intuition is that even with all the progress to date, we could do even more here. For example, one perennial question for policymakers is, \u201cWill it work <i>here</i>?\u201d</p><p>Which is a reasonable question. Yes, an education program might have reduced high school dropouts in Seattle, but will it work in the Houston school district, with a population of largely poor, minority students (many of whom speak English as a second language)? We need better ways to figure out whether and how often evidence is transportable across different contexts and populations, and then give guidance to time-strapped policymakers across the country.</p><p><i><strong>Community Building</strong></i></p><p><i><strong>BITSS</strong></i></p><p>The Berkeley Initiative for Transparency in the Social Sciences (or BITSS) had its first annual meeting in December 2012.

Those grants included:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.arnoldventures.org/grants/center-for-open-science-inc-14\"><u>$204,729</u></a> in 2013 to collaborate with the Center for Open Science in training researchers to use the Open Science Framework software.<ul><li>This grant included two summer institutes for PhD students, which eventually evolved into the flagship Research Transparency and Reproducibility Trainings (RT2), which continue today. It also&nbsp;allowed BITSS to create a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://github.com/garretchristensen/BestPracticesManual/\"><u>manual of best practices in transparent social science research</u></a>, write a chapter on transparency in the textbook&nbsp;<a href=\"https://elibrary.worldbank.org/doi/abs/10.1596/978-0-8213-8541-8\"><u>Impact Evaluation&nbsp;in Practice</u></a>, and contribute to the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cos.io/initiatives/top-guidelines\"><u>TOP guidelines</u></a>.</li></ul></li><li><a href=\"https://www.arnoldventures.org/grants/regents-of-the-university-of-california-at-berkeley-41\"><u>$680,118</u></a> in 2015 to sponsor the <a href=\"http://www.bitss.org/project-tag/ssmart/\"><u>SSMART competition</u></a> (Social Science Meta-Analysis and Research Transparency) to identify and fund new papers/articles on meta-science in political science and economics, and a supplemental grant of <a href=\"https://www.arnoldventures.org/grants/regents-of-the-university-of-california-at-berkeley-40\"><u>$58,142</u></a> to support a couple of extra projects identified as worthy of funding. &nbsp;A lot of great meta-science papers were the result. A couple of examples: &nbsp;<ul><li>Cristina Blanco-Perez and Abel Brodeur\u2019s <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/ej/article/130/629/1226/5716665?login=false\"><u>article</u></a> showing that when health economics journals issued a statement about their willingness to publish null results, the number of positive and significant results went down by 18 percentage points.</li><li>Rachael Meager\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.20181811\"><i><u>American Economic Review</u></i><u> article</u></a> developing new Bayesian hierarchical models for aggregating treatment effects across different studies. (Note: Rachael\u2019s working paper was posted in <a href=\"https://osf.io/preprints/metaarxiv/7tkvm/\"><u>late 2016</u></a>, but the AER version didn\u2019t come out until 2022!)</li></ul></li><li><a href=\"https://www.arnoldventures.org/grants/regents-of-the-university-of-california-at-berkeley-39\"><u>$408,719</u></a> in 2016 to fund outreach and training activities.<ul><li>This grant partially supported three events (two international),&nbsp;ten on-demand workshops at academic and policy research organizations, two workshops at BITSS Annual Meetings, and two course runs of the BITSS Massive Online Open Course (MOOC), \u201cTransparent and Open Social Science Research.\u201d It allowed BITSS to significantly grow our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.bitss.org/catalysts/\"><u>BITSS Catalyst network</u></a>, which today includes nearly 160 researchers in 30 countries who are estimated to trained over 20,000 additional researchers in transparency tools and methods. The Catalyst program is about to be re-booted with support from a relatively new BITSS donor (TWCF). Additionally, the grant supported engagement with over&nbsp;80 journal editors and 200 science journalists on open science practices, and helped secure funding for a successful pilot of Registered Reports at the Journal of Development Economics. Finally, it allowed BITSS to disseminate several important research products, including the textbook <a href=\"https://www.ucpress.edu/book/9780520296954/transparent-and-reproducible-social-science-research\"><i><u>Transparent and Reproducible Research</u></i></a>, a paper on \"<a href=\"https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/jel.20171350&amp;&amp;from=f\"><u>Transparency, Reproducibility and the Credibility of Economics Research</u></a>,\" and the <a href=\"https://osf.io/preprints/metaarxiv/5rksu/\"><u>State of Social Science (3S)</u></a> Survey.</li></ul></li><li><a href=\"https://www.arnoldventures.org/grants/regents-of-the-university-of-california-at-berkeley-28\"><u>$590,571</u></a> in 2019 to help train researchers to comply with the American Economic Association policy on submitting data and code.</li></ul><p>With the last grant there, BITSS also created the <a href=\"https://www.socialsciencereproduction.org/\"><u>Social Science Reproduction Platform</u></a>. One of the goals here was to eliciat information about replications performed as part of graduate education in political science, economics, etc. After all, some graduate students perform replication as part of a class on methods or data analysis, and it might be useful to know the results. As of now, the platform hosts <a href=\"https://www.socialsciencereproduction.org/metrics\"><u>information on 218 replications of 140 papers</u></a>. Many of these replications have come from Abel Brodeur\u2019s new <a href=\"https://i4replication.org/\"><u>Institute for Replication</u></a>, an excellent effort that was launched after I left Arnold and hence never got the chance to support.</p><p>I think these replication efforts should be expanded ten-fold, including other disciplines. Indeed, whenever someone does a graduate degree that depends on analyzing data (whether it be economics or epidemiology), that student\u2019s training ought to include replicating an existing study from its publicly available data. Hands-on data analysis like that is enormously useful (probably more so than toy exercises in an econometrics or statistics class), and the rest of the field should be able to benefit from seeing the replication success of numerous articles.</p><p><i><strong>J-PAL</strong></i></p><p>Around the 2016 timeframe, the American Economics Association was trying to popularize its <a href=\"https://www.socialscienceregistry.org/\"><u>registry for economics experiments</u></a>, and J-PAL North America at MIT (long a significant Arnold grantee) wanted to pay for some substantial staff time to register and report the results of many existing RCTs, and as well as to train researchers on good transparency practices. I made <a href=\"https://www.arnoldventures.org/grants/massachusetts-institute-of-technology-11\"><u>a grant of $486,000</u></a> to J-PAL for that purpose, and was satisfied that it was reasonably successful.</p><p><i><strong>Ecology/Evolution</strong></i></p><p>In 2015, I got a proposal from <a href=\"https://www.whitman.edu/academics/majors-and-minors/biology/faculty-and-staff/tim-parker\"><u>Tim Parker</u></a> of Whitman College, <a href=\"https://www.unsw.edu.au/staff/shinichi-nakagawa\"><u>Shinichi Nakagawa</u></a> of the Univ. of New South Wales, and <a href=\"https://www.stonybrook.edu/commcms/ecoevo/_people/_faculty_pages/gurevitch.php\"><u>Jessica Gurevitch</u></a> of Stony Brook University, on \u201cDeveloping Editorial and Funding Policies to Improve Inference in Evolutionary Biology and Ecology.\u201d They pointed to <a href=\"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fevo.2014.00076/full\"><u>evidence</u></a> that those related fields were publishing too many false positives, unreplicable work, etc.</p><p>I made <a href=\"https://www.arnoldventures.org/grants/center-for-open-science-inc-13\"><u>a grant of $77,962</u></a> for them to host a meeting with Center for Open Science, drawing leaders in the field from arounds the world. The key impacts of the eco-evo meeting were the creation of the Society for Open, Reliable, and Transparent Ecology and Evolutionary Biology (<a href=\"https://www.sortee.org/\"><u>SORTEE</u></a>), a <a href=\"https://osf.io/y8aqx\"><u>list of tools and standards</u></a> that journals could use for this research, and eventually the <a href=\"https://ecoevorxiv.org/\"><u>EcoEvoRxiv preprint service</u></a>. It is also possible that the increased activity in ecology and evolutionary biology may have helped inspire <a href=\"https://aimos.community/\"><u>AIMOS</u></a> (Association for Interdisciplinary Meta-Research and Open Science), which has a significant presence in those fields.</p><p>A larger comment: There are of course many meetings where not much happens except that people present findings from their recent papers, other people ask some long questions that are really comments in disguise, and everyone goes home afterwards. The benefits are that people gain some knowledge, socialize with their colleagues, and hopefully think of new ideas for future studies.</p><p>But between this grant and the TOP Guidelines grant, I am convinced that meetings can do much more than the usual fare. That is, meetings can be one of the most effective ways to create future policy change. It all depends on whether the meeting taps into a current zeitgeist where there is an appetite for reform, and then sets out a meeting agenda that is sufficiently action-oriented (i.e., does it have a specific goal in mind towards which every attendee is expected to contribute?).</p><p><strong>IV.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><i><strong>Make It Rewarding</strong></i><br><br><i><strong>Chris Chambers and Registered Reports</strong></i></p><p>As many readers know, registered reports are a new type of scholarly article in which scholars submit a <i>proposed</i> study to a journal; the journal conducts peer review and provisionally accepts the study (based on the proposed design, data collection, etc.); and <i>then</i> the scholars actually conduct the study. If all goes according to plan, the journal will then publish the finished product regardless of results.</p><p>While registered reports aren\u2019t applicable to all research by any means, they could be particularly useful for confirmatory experiments, clinical trials, etc. For one thing, you get feedback from peer reviewers at a time when it is possible to change how you set up the experiment in the first place, rather than getting crucial feedback only when it\u2019s too late.</p><p>For another thing, it can help prevent publication bias wherein editors and reviewers lean more towards publishing only positive and statistically significant results. <a href=\"https://psyarxiv.com/p6e9c/\"><u>Initial evidence</u></a> on matched studies in psychology suggests that the rate of publishing positive results is cut by more than half:</p><p><a href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F130d6627-e2f5-4770-b927-e75abdb22e71_609x617.png\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F130d6627-e2f5-4770-b927-e75abdb22e71_609x617.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F130d6627-e2f5-4770-b927-e75abdb22e71_609x617.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F130d6627-e2f5-4770-b927-e75abdb22e71_609x617.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F130d6627-e2f5-4770-b927-e75abdb22e71_609x617.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F130d6627-e2f5-4770-b927-e75abdb22e71_609x617.png 1456w\"></a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>That said, this isn\u2019t a perfect comparison. Scholars who want to test risky hypotheses or who have the least confidence in a positive result (for whatever reason) might be the most likely to opt for a registered report pathway than for the usual pathway. Nonetheless, registered reports seemed intuitively obvious (for certain types of publications) as better than the usual.</p><p>The person most associated with registered reports is <a href=\"https://profiles.cardiff.ac.uk/staff/chambersc1\"><u>Chris Chambers</u></a> of Cardiff University in the UK.

The letter noted that since May of 2013, the neuroscience journal that Chambers edited (<i>Cortex</i>) had offered authors the possibility of publishing their work via a registered report. He had been doggedly working on the issue (the <a href=\"http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcblog/2017/08/24/bmc-medicine-becomes-the-first-medical-journal-to-accept-registered-reports/\"><u>first medical journal started offering registered reports in 2017</u></a>), but needed a grant to buy out his time at Cardiff University.</p><p>I awarded Chambers a <a href=\"https://www.arnoldventures.org/grants/cardiff-university\"><u>grant</u></a> of $240,000 from 2020 to 2024, with the idea that he could spend more time interacting with journal editors and advocating for registered reports. He partnered with the Center for Open Science on this work, and as of now, over <a href=\"https://www.cos.io/initiatives/registered-reports\"><u>300 journals offer registered reports</u></a> as a publishing option. He also worked to establish a website tracking how well journals and publishers are doing (<a href=\"https://registeredreports.cardiff.ac.uk/feedback/dashboards\"><u>Registered Reports Community Feedback</u></a>) and a platform to offer peer review of registered reports, with the hope of taking control of the review process currently offered by journals and academic publishers (the <a href=\"https://rr.peercommunityin.org/\"><u>Peer Community in Registered Reports platform</u></a>).</p><p>Most recently, <i>Nature</i> (the most high-profile journal to date) signed on.

I think that clinical trials in medicine should be published <i>only </i>as registered reports, for example. Unlike any other area of scientific research, clinical trials are already mostly <i>required by law and by funder policies</i> to be registered in advance of the trial\u2019s launch. It would be relatively easy to change the journal submission process so that clinical trial articles are submitted before trial launch rather than after completion. As mentioned above, this would allow peer reviewers to make comments in time to alter the trial\u2019s protocol (if necessary), and would force the journal to make a publication decision independent of the trial\u2019s results.&nbsp;</p><p><i><strong>Prizes</strong></i></p><p>One way to make research practices rewarding is simply to offer rewards or prizes for the behaviors in question. This isn\u2019t a permanent solution, but it could be a way to jump start the acceptance of new behavioral patterns in a given field. At least, so we thought.</p><p>Starting in the days when hardly anyone in social science had heard of preregistration, we sponsored a couple of prizes for preregistering studies.

But at the time, it seemed that too few people had even heard of preregistration (outside of clinical trials), and we thought it would help jump-start things (or at least draw attention) if we offered a reward. Did it work? Hard to say definitively, but Brian Nosek emailed these thoughts, which seem reasonable:</p><p>I perceive the Preregistration Challenge as playing a central role in consolidating interest, action, and understanding about the behavior. It is obviously very hard to pin down what adoption would have looked like without the Prereg Challenge. But it got plenty of awareness and engagement. We could never get around the self-selection effects of who decided to participate in the Challenge, but I bet that any investigation we did would show that (a) fields with strong participation in the challenge showed more acceleration after the challenge in adoption than neighboring fields, and (b) people that participated in the challenge continued to be more invested in prereg after the challenge than others who are as similar as possible in every other way.</p><p><i><strong>An Election Research Prize</strong></i></p><p>In 2016, I worked with Arthur \u201cSkip\u201d Lupia and Brendan Nyhan to create the <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20160817151140/http:/www.erpc2016.com/\"><u>Election Research Preacceptance Competition</u></a>, namely, a contest to publish preregistered articles about the 2016 US election, using a traditional source of political science data (<a href=\"https://electionstudies.org/\"><u>the American National Election Studies, or ANES</u></a>).

From <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9684978/\"><u>an article on a similar initiative</u></a> as to the German 2021 election:</p><blockquote><p>Although more than 50&nbsp;analysis plans were preregistered with a&nbsp;public registry, only two papers were eventually published in this competition (Enders and Scott&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9684978/#CR12\"><u>2019</u></a>; Monogan&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9684978/#CR27\"><u>2020</u></a>). The organizers (personal communication) suspect that the low number of publications was due to the fact that most preregistrations were submitted by early-career scholars who might have lacked experience on how to implement their ideas. In retrospect, the organizers concluded that the initiative could have benefited from early-career scholars receiving advice and mentoring from experienced researchers at the crucial stages of the process.</p></blockquote><p>I asked Lupia and Nyhan for their thoughts, and one of them told me: \u201cI think in general the competition struggled with the intersection of (a) people not being experienced with preregistration workflows (regardless of seniority) and (b) the difficulty of publishing ANES findings because they were seen as not novel enough and/or came out as nulls.\u201d</p><h3><strong>V.&nbsp; </strong><i><strong>Make It Required: Policy/Advocacy</strong></i></h3><p>In hindsight, perhaps we could have done more as to policy and advocacy. I only made a few such grants. That said, if I had been asked in 2014 or 2015 whether it made sense to do a ton of grantmaking on direct policies and mandates, I would have thought it was largely premature. As seen above, for example, replication was very controversial at the time\u2014trying to <i>mandate</i> replications would have gone nowhere. You can\u2019t leapfrog the pyramid, at least not very successfully: even if you managed to persuade top policymakers to issue a top-down mandate, it would be circumvented, ignored, and shot down quickly if there was no low-level buy-in.</p><p>&nbsp;<i><strong>AllTrials</strong></i></p><p>I saw the success that Ben Goldacre had with the AllTrials campaign in the UK and EU, and hoped to be able to replicate it in the United States. That is, I thought it made sense for patient advocacy groups and others to join forces to demand that clinical trials be rigorous and transparent, with no hidden results.</p><p>I sought out Trevor Butterworth to run an AllTrials campaign in the United States. I had seen Trevor in a well-spoken <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwgnuoIG8xs\"><u>interview</u></a>, and thought he would be perfect. I gave a grant of <a href=\"https://www.arnoldventures.org/grants/sense-about-science-usa\"><u>$1.5 million to Sense About Science USA</u></a> (the parallel to Sense About Science UK, the group that technically ran the AllTrials campaign).</p><p>Trevor and his team launched an AllTrials campaign in the US, and over time were able to win endorsements from groups like the American Medical Association, the AARP, and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network. But the movement wasn\u2019t just a campaign for organizational endorsements. A significant problem with clinical trial transparency is that lofty policy statements often ran aground on local capacities. That is, everyone in theory might agree with slogans like \u201call trials reported,\u201d but what does that mean to the research manager at an academic hospital like MD Anderson who would need to spend significant time chasing down results and then reporting them publicly?</p><p>Trevor and the Sense About Science folks settled on a \u201ctrain the trainer\u201d strategy. To quote from one of their reports, \u201cWe want to identify, train and support people who are passionate about transparency in a way that enables them to: a) advocate effectively and b) train others in their community to become effective advocates.\u201d The group then ran workshops at places like New York University and UC San Diego, among others. As well, they were working in 2017-18 with Memorial Sloan Kettering and New York\u2019s Department of Health and Mental Hygiene on producing a patients\u2019 guide to clinical trial transparency.</p><p>Along with the clinical trial work, Sense About Science USA <a href=\"https://senseaboutscienceusa.org/stats-check/\"><u>launched a partnership</u></a> with the American Statistical Association to provide statistical consulting to journalists, with the hope of improving statistical literacy and the overall quality of journalism.</p><p><a href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0aa7c903-1867-4ab5-aba4-a163291f6179_386x473.png\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0aa7c903-1867-4ab5-aba4-a163291f6179_386x473.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0aa7c903-1867-4ab5-aba4-a163291f6179_386x473.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0aa7c903-1867-4ab5-aba4-a163291f6179_386x473.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0aa7c903-1867-4ab5-aba4-a163291f6179_386x473.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0aa7c903-1867-4ab5-aba4-a163291f6179_386x473.png 1456w\"></a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As well, they ran many meetings and workshops aimed at journalists, including a workshop for biomedical journal editors at Springer Nature.</p><p><a href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F623a463e-1fb3-4be4-8799-7f7b1571d3d2_565x752.png\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F623a463e-1fb3-4be4-8799-7f7b1571d3d2_565x752.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F623a463e-1fb3-4be4-8799-7f7b1571d3d2_565x752.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F623a463e-1fb3-4be4-8799-7f7b1571d3d2_565x752.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F623a463e-1fb3-4be4-8799-7f7b1571d3d2_565x752.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F623a463e-1fb3-4be4-8799-7f7b1571d3d2_565x752.png 1456w\"></a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In the end, I included this grant as one about policy and advocacy, but it did more to engage in community training than to change policy.</p><p><i><strong>Yale CRIT</strong></i></p><p>The <a href=\"https://law.yale.edu/crit\"><u>Yale Collaboration for Research Integrity and Transparency</u></a> (CRIT) was borne out of conversations with Joe Ross and Harlan Krumholz at Yale, both of whom had done great work in pushing for clinical trial transparency.

That committee wanted to investigate how the federal government collects statistics in an era where fewer and fewer people respond to surveys, not to mention many other problems. Survey non-response is a huge issue\u2014for example, the Consumer Expenditure Survey (used to help calculate everything from the inflation rate to national health spending) had a <a href=\"http://www.asasrms.org/Proceedings/y2006/Files/JSM2006-000452.pdf\"><u>response rate of 86% in 1990</u></a>, but by the end of 2018, that had <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/cex/dqreport2018.pdf\"><u>dropped to 55%</u></a>.</p><p>I awarded CNSTAT <a href=\"https://www.arnoldventures.org/grants/national-academy-of-sciences-19\"><u>a grant of $828,349</u></a> in 2015 to fund what became two reports on how to improve federal data collection and statistics.

At the same time, administrative data has been growing, even though we often don\u2019t know enough about the quality or sources of such data. Thus, the idea behind the report was to \u201cfoster a possible shift in federal statistical programs\u2014from the current approach of providing users with the output from a single census, survey, or administrative records source to a new paradigm of combining data sources with state-of-the-art methods.\u201d</p><p>The first report concluded that there are too many legal and administrative barriers to the use of administrative data, that federal statistical agencies should look at the benefits of using private data, that agencies should collaborate with academia and industry to develop new techniques to address confidentiality, that agencies should use new techniques to protect privacy, and that a \u201cnew entity\u201d should try to enable \u201csecure access to data for statistical purposes to enhance the quality of federal statistics.\u201d</p><p>The second, <a href=\"https://nap.nationalacademies.org/catalog/24893/federal-statistics-multiple-data-sources-and-privacy-protection-next-steps\"><u>Federal Statistics, Multiple Data Sources, and Privacy Protection: Next Steps</u></a>, built on the first report by trying to assess new ways for combining diverse data resources (government or private sector). The report recommended that federal agencies redesign current methods so as to use multiple data sources, learn new ways to combine them, and figure out how to work with multiple organizations across the public and private sector. Moreover, agencies should look for ways to safeguard privacy even while combining datasets for research purposes. Finally, the panel recommended the creation of a new entity that would provide a secure environment for analyzing data, would coordinate the use and acquisition of data, and would work with federal agencies to identify research priorities.</p><p>The results? In 2018, the Office of Management and Budget <a href=\"https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2018-01-12/pdf/2018-00400.pdf\"><u>cited</u></a> CNSTAT\u2019s work as \u201cimportant work\u201d on which \u201cmore research\u201d would be needed \u201cbefore the Federal Statistical System can adopt these techniques for the production of its key statistics.\u201d</p><p>More importantly, these reports from CNSTAT laid the groundwork for redirecting CNSTAT\u2019s approach and strategy towards a grand, forward-looking vision of national statistics\u2014one that was labeled an integrated national data infrastructure. CNSTAT issued two reports in 2023 (funded by the National Science Foundation) that show how data generated on the activities of persons and enterprises are actually national resources, and showing that countries that mobilize those data to inform citizenry about the welfare of the country can build stronger economies and societies.</p><p>The first report was titled: \u201c<a href=\"https://nap.nationalacademies.org/catalog/26688/toward-a-21st-century-national-data-infrastructure-mobilizing-information-for-the-common-good\"><u>Toward a 21</u><sup><u>st</u></sup><u> Century National Data Infrastructure: Mobilizing Information for the Common Good</u></a>.\u201d The overarching theory was that the United States \u201cneeds a new 21st century national data infrastructure that blends data from multiple sources to improve the quality, timeliness, granularity, and usefulness of national statistics, facilitates more rigorous social and economic research, and supports evidence-based policymaking and program evaluations.\u201d This new national data infrastructure should be prepared to include all sources of data (federal, state, private, etc.), and should have the following seven attributes:</p><blockquote><p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Safeguards and advanced privacy-enhancing practices to minimize possible individual harm.</p><p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Statistical uses only, for common-good information, with statistical aggregates freely shared with all.</p><p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mobilization of relevant digital data assets, blended in statistical aggregates to providing benefits to data holders, with societal benefits proportionate to possible costs and risks.</p><p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reformed legal authorities protecting all parties\u2019 interests.</p><p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Governance framework and standards effectively supporting operations.</p><p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Transparency to the public regarding analytical operations using the infrastructure.</p><p>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; State-of-the-art practices for access, statistical, coordination, and computational activities; continuously improved to efficiently create increasingly secure and useful information.</p></blockquote><p>The second report was titled: \u201c<a href=\"https://nap.nationalacademies.org/catalog/26804/toward-a-21st-century-national-data-infrastructure-enhancing-survey-programs-by-using-multiple-data-sources\"><u>Toward a 21</u><sup><u>st</u></sup><u> Century National Data Infrastructure: Enhancing Survey Programs by Using Multiple Data Sources</u></a>.\u201d This report delved much deeper into the weeds of how you\u2019d actually construct a national data infrastructure. For example, how do you probabilistically link administrative data to survey data in way that results in improved overall statistics? How should imputation be used for missing data elements? Who determines informed consent provisions for data drawn from many different sources? The report also discussed in detail numerous existing federal data sources, how they work, and how they could be improved (everything from Census datasets and Labor datasets to the June Area Survey that collects information on crops, grains, cattle, hogs, etc.).</p><p>In short, a national data infrastructure that combines administrative and survey data is the future of federal statistics. CNSTAT is a centrally important place where top experts on this issue come together to discuss the path forward, and I\u2019m happy to have helped them along this path several years ago.</p><p><i><strong>New Orleans Schools: Tulane and Blueprint</strong></i></p><p>In 2012, the Arnold Foundation announced some <a href=\"https://www.philanthropyroundtable.org/almanac/new-orleans-school-district-goes-all-charter/\"><u>$40 million in grants</u></a> intended to transform the New Orleans school system. As the new Director of Research (my first and brief title), I started to think about how we could evaluate the success of promoting charter schools in New Orleans. It\u2019s a difficult question\u2014students aren\u2019t randomly assigned to be in New Orleans versus elsewhere, and we couldn\u2019t randomly assign New Orleans to adopt a new school system. Was there still going to be a way to compare New Orleans to anywhere else?</p><p>I solicited two large grants that launched new organizations/centers that continue to this day. Each organization ended up specializing in different ways of assessing school success.</p><p>First, I worked with the economist <a href=\"https://liberalarts.tulane.edu/departments/economics/people/douglas-harris\"><u>Douglas Harris</u></a> on creating a new education research center at Tulane. It ended up being called the <a href=\"https://educationresearchalliancenola.org/\"><u>Education Research Alliance for New Orleans</u></a>. We gave ERA three significant grants as operational support: <a href=\"https://www.arnoldventures.org/grants/administrators-of-the-tulane-educational-fund-aka-tulane-university-5\"><u>$2.8 million in 2014</u></a> for the initial launch, and subsequent grants of <a href=\"https://www.arnoldventures.org/grants/administrators-of-the-tulane-educational-fund-aka-tulane-university-5\"><u>$740,479</u></a> and <a href=\"https://www.arnoldventures.org/grants/administrators-of-the-tulane-educational-fund-aka-tulane-university-2\"><u>$1.4 million</u></a>.</p><p>The ERA team and their associated research fellows have published <a href=\"https://educationresearchalliancenola.org/publications\"><u>a wide range of analyses and evaluations</u></a> of the New Orleans school system since the post-Katrina reforms, including evaluations of New Orleans students compared to similar students elsewhere in the state, the effect of transportation on school choice, the effect of education reform on adolescent crime, and much more.</p><p>The key to ERA\u2019s success (as with research-practitioner partnerships more broadly) is developing strong relationships with local stakeholders who are willing to provide data, to provide input on study topics and the like, and to listen even when an evaluation shows uncomfortable results. Research and evaluation, in other words, aren\u2019t successful when they come across as a bloodless and robotic analysis of numbers, but when they arise out of a human relationship of trust and good faith.</p><p>Second, I saw <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2013/01/02/180812/the-natural-experimenter/\"><u>a Jan. 2, 2013 article</u></a> about an MIT economist named Joshua Angrist and his then-recent interest in education research.</p><p><a href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F313be8e7-e955-422a-b641-012943d448ad_742x463.png\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F313be8e7-e955-422a-b641-012943d448ad_742x463.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F313be8e7-e955-422a-b641-012943d448ad_742x463.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F313be8e7-e955-422a-b641-012943d448ad_742x463.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F313be8e7-e955-422a-b641-012943d448ad_742x463.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F313be8e7-e955-422a-b641-012943d448ad_742x463.png 1456w\"></a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I reached out to Angrist, and had conference calls with him and Pathak about their ideas. Pathak had actually helped to design the \u201cOneApp\u201d system used in New Orleans to match families to schools, given all of the various preferences involved (e.g., neighborhood, family members, etc.).</p><p>Their new idea was to develop new methods for using all of the information on family and school preferences to create algorithms that would essentially find unseen randomization within the school choice process\u2014that is, some students had a similar likelihood (given the school choice algorithm) of getting into a particular school, but then one of them would get in and the other wouldn\u2019t (thus creating a mini-RCT between the two schools involved). Figure out each student\u2019s propensity to get into each school, and each possible \u201cmini-RCT\u201d comparison, and you\u2019d have large-scale information on which New Orleans schools were more successful.</p><p>But it was enormously complicated, and Angrist told me at the outset that it was still unknown if this would even be possible. Our <a href=\"https://www.arnoldventures.org/grants/massachusetts-institute-of-technology-12\"><u>initial grant</u></a> was for a mere $71,524, to help support a graduate student.</p><p>Based on initial and promising results, I was able to get Angrist et al. <a href=\"https://www.arnoldventures.org/grants/massachusetts-institute-of-technology-12\"><u>a grant of $1,941,622</u></a> in 2018 to support their further work on using enrollment data to measure school quality in New York City and Denver (website&nbsp;<a href=\"https://blueprintlabs.mit.edu/research/using-admissions-lotteries-to-validate-and-improve-school-quality-measures/\"><u>here</u></a>).&nbsp;Based on the findings from this project, the lab successfully raised $1 million in funding from the Walton Family Foundation to launch a related line of work with Greatschools.org, NYC, and Denver to remove racial bias in school quality measures (forthcoming in the AER, preprint&nbsp;<a href=\"https://blueprintlabs.mit.edu/research/race-and-the-mismeasure-of-school-quality/\"><u>here</u></a>). Currently, the research team is planning an experiment with NYC and Greatschools.org to randomly offer families less-biased school quality measures to understand how they influence enrollment behaviors.</p><p>He and others ended up creating the School Effectiveness and Inequality Initiative, which then turned into <a href=\"https://blueprintlabs.mit.edu/about/\"><u>Blueprint Labs</u></a>. Blueprint advertises itself as using \u201cdata and economics to uncover the consequences of policy decisions and improve society.\u201d The Arnold grant was the first major source of support that helped launch Blueprint\u2019s education research efforts, which continue in full force today. The lab is currently in the process of launching a charter school research collaborative with support from the City Fund, Bloomberg Philanthropies, the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, and the Walton Family Foundation.</p><p>Besides being smart and accomplished, Josh is one of the most bad*** people I\u2019ve ever known.

A specific example: some doctors recommend MRIs too often, leading to higher expense and unnecessary radiation for the patient. What if that doctor saw an electronic system that gave advice like, \u201cThis patient isn\u2019t likely to benefit from an MRI\u201d? Would the doctor listen to the system, or would he (it\u2019s usually a \u201che\u201d in this situation) demand an MRI regardless? Would we save money, and would patients be better off? Or the opposite?</p><p>Amy Finkelstein of MIT approached me in 2014 or 2015 with the thought that we had already given $15 million to help launch J-PAL North America, with its focus on randomized trials on policies and programs, and maybe she shouldn\u2019t ask for anything else. I told her that we were always open to new ideas.</p><p>So she pitched me on an idea of partnering with hospitals to do an RCT of a new policy that Medicare was <a href=\"https://www.cms.gov/medicare/quality-initiatives-patient-assessment-instruments/appropriate-use-criteria-program\"><u>about to roll out under the Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014</u></a>\u2014that is, requiring that high-cost scans couldn\u2019t be reimbursed unless the hospital had a clinical decision support system in place. The idea was to randomize doctors to see the electronic recommendation (or not), and then see if they actually behaved differently.</p><p>We gave <a href=\"https://www.arnoldventures.org/grants/massachusetts-institute-of-technology-13\"><u>a grant of $1,156,095</u></a> to Amy\u2019s project in 2015. This project had a major hiccup\u2014the original hospital partner turned out to have failed the randomization (that is, they didn\u2019t actually randomize any doctor to the control group!). But Amy\u2019s team didn\u2019t find out for a long time, because due to HIPAA regulations, they hadn\u2019t been able to see the data (and see that no one was in the control group). She told me that a lesson learned was that when working with hospitals, place someone at the hospital who is allowed by HIPAA to see real-time data in order to check whether everything is actually going as planned.</p><p>With a new hospital partner, Amy and her colleagues <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6419998/\"><u>published results in 2019</u></a>: the clinical decision support system \u201creduced targeted imaging orders by a statistically significant 6%, however there was no statistically significant change in the total number of high-cost scans or of low-cost scans.\u201d In other words, a potentially expensive national mandate to provide these recommendation systems might not make any meaningful difference to the actual use of high-cost scans.</p><p><i><strong>The John Oliver Show</strong></i></p><p>My experience consulting with the John Oliver show is hard to categorize, as it was thoroughly serendipitous and not part of a broader communications strategy. Indeed, I doubt I\u2019d have been able to get scientific reproducibility on the John Oliver show if I had tried!</p><p>Take a step back: In 2016, I was bothered by how many journalists wrote breathless stories about the latest miracle cure from nutrition, cancer, etc., whereas the stories were based on studies in mice or rats. I decided to write up an article arguing that journalists should simply stop reporting on mice and rat studies. After all, even the best mice/rat studies might not pay off in humans, so why should we distract the public with the false hope of a cure for cancer or heart disease?</p><p>I shopped the piece around, but it was a little too dense for major publications, nor was it tied to any current event in the news. So, I just published it on the Arnold Foundation website (it\u2019s still available <a href=\"https://www.arnoldventures.org/stories/stop-publishing-mouse-studies\"><u>here</u></a>).</p><p>Shortly thereafter, I got word that a journalist from the John Oliver show wanted to talk to me. Her name was Liz Day (she is currently at the <i>New York Times</i>). When we chatted, it turned out that she had been searching for experts on mice/rats, and thought I was just such an expert. Not true, I assured her. I was simply someone who cared about the quality and relevance of medical studies, and of journalism reporting on them.</p><p>Fortunately, it didn\u2019t matter that I wasn\u2019t a mouse expert. She was actually producing a script for a story on scientific reproducibility, where mouse research was just one of the potential topics.</p><p>She and I ended up exchanging <i>several thousand words</i> of emails about a script for a then-upcoming show. I also provided her with potential interviews and video sources. Along with Meredith McPhail (who worked for me), I sent Liz Day many comments on the actual script regarding mouse studies, p-hacking, distinguishing \u201codds\u201d from \u201cprobability,\u201d oxytocin studies, nutrition studies, the FDA approval process, and most of all, how to define p-values.</p><p>For example, their original script at one point had said, \u201cA p-value is a measure scientists use to identify real causal relationships from flukish coincidence.\u201d Obviously, that\u2019s not correct (technically, it IS correct to say that many scientists think this way, but that\u2019s because they have no idea what a p-value actually means!).</p><p>In response, I rewrote the script, and added: \u201cA p-value does NOT tell you the probability that the finding is due to chance. Rather, a p-value <i>assumes</i> that only chance is at work. That is, a p-value tells you, \u2018If nothing other than chance were operating here, and if I collected data in the same way many times, what percentage of the time would the data look this extreme or more just by chance?\u2019 Or to make that shorter, a p-value tells you, \u2018If there is not a real effect here, how often would mere chance produce data where there seems to be an effect?\u2019\u201d</p><p>Her response: \u201cThank you, thank you, thank you again. We're crashing on this piece (we usually have much more time) but want to make sure we're being bulletproof with our accuracy (given that we're criticizing others' for sloppily talking about science).\u201d</p><p>The episode came out in May 2016, and is available <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rnq1NpHdmw\"><u>here</u></a>.

One of the people on the panel was <a href=\"https://www.berryconsultants.com/don-berry/\"><u>Don Berry</u></a>, who for many years was the head of biostatistics at MD Anderson, and who had helped design hundreds of clinical trials. In an email discussion prior to the conference, he told the other panelists to watch the John Oliver segment, and added: \u201cI suspect that Stuart too played a role in the show. Oliver couldn\u2019t have developed this level of sophistication without very, very competent advice.\u201d</p><p>I responded to confirm that Don Berry\u2019s suspicions were right, and asked how he had known? His response: \u201cThanks Stuart. You never told me you were involved. But I could count on the fingers of one hand the people who could be the brains behind this show, and you were the index finger.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019ll admit to a bit of self-aggrandizement in retelling these stories . . . but they are also a symptom of a broader problem. How routinely awful must science communication and journalism be, if multiple people were surprised that the John Oliver show could get even the most elementary facts about statistics correct? What would it say if every time anyone publicly mentioned gravity, physicists had to hold their breath to see whether someone said gravity <i>increases</i> with the square of distance, rather than being <i>inversely</i> proportional to distance squared? It shouldn\u2019t be so difficult, or so surprising, for journalists to get basic issues correct.</p><p>On another note: How much difference did a John Oliver show episode make to any of the issues that I was working on? Hard to say. But as with much in philanthropy and communications/advocacy, the long-term impact of such efforts might far outstrip our ability to measure and quantify the impact.</p><p><i><strong>Nutrition</strong></i></p><p>After the demise of the Nutrition Science Initiative, I worked with my employee Meredith McPhail to launch two RFPs focused on nutrition. One was on rigorous ways to measure the effect of fat versus carbs, and the other was on innovative ways to measure what people actually eat.</p><p>We ended up funding an <a href=\"https://www.arnoldventures.org/grants/childrens-hospital-corporation-dba-childrens-hospital-boston\"><u>$11 million trial</u></a> with David Ludwig of Harvard and David Allison of Indiana University, both highly reputable nutrition scholars. The trial was going to be the biggest-ever in-patient study of fat vs. carbs with a highly-controlled diet in a highly-controlled setting.</p><p>Sadly, the Covid pandemic interfered. The trial had completed 1/3 of the total planned enrollment when the pandemic lockdown hit during a cohort with the next 1/3 in residence. The trial became a nightmare. It was touch and go for everyone, modifying the protocol ad lib to prioritize safety. For example, the trialists couldn\u2019t just send people to their homes around the country, as this would have involved exposure risk during travel. Yet bringing in staff to oversee the trial and prepare food itself was risky. The trialists decided to end the trial early, resulting in an underpowered trial (2/3 expected total) with quality-control issues involving half the completed participants.</p><p>Even so, the trialists plan to make the best of it. Their <a href=\"https://diabetesjournals.org/care/article/45/3/576/141013/Prolonged-Glycemic-Adaptation-Following-Transition\"><u>first major paper was published in </u><i><u>Diabetes Care</u></i></a>, on how glucose metrics respond when people switch from a low-carb to high-carb diet. And they hope to produce a major paper on the main question later this year.</p><p><i><strong>Causal Inference</strong></i></p><p>Several years ago, I noticed that the Atlantic Society for Causal Inference featured a ton of my academic friends and colleagues who were thinking about how best to estimate the causal impact of policies, treatments, programs, etc. In my experience, this is by far the most amazingly cool academic society: Top statisticians like Brad Carlin, Mike Jordan, and Jennifer Hill formed a band called the <a href=\"https://imposteriors.wixsite.com/imposteriors/the-band\"><u>Imposteriors</u></a> that plays cover songs at society events\u2014and they were actually good. Not just \u201cgood\u201d on a charitable scale where you think \u201ca 10 for academics but a 2 in the real world.\u201d <i>They are actually good</i>. Better than a lot of live bands.</p><p>But the society was scraping by from year to year, essentially having to start up from scratch every time they met. I gave them a grant that at <a href=\"https://www.arnoldventures.org/grants/trustees-of-the-university-of-pennsylvania-15\"><u>a mere $81,579</u></a> allowed them to have a more solid base to coordinate resources, and to rename it to the <a href=\"https://sci-info.org/\"><u>Society for Causal Inference</u></a> so that it didn\u2019t seem as geographically limited.</p><p>I don\u2019t know that this grant had a major impact on anything but the Society for Causal Inference itself, but I do think there should be a place in philanthropy for using relatively small grants to help modernize or refashion existing institutions. Too many non-profits get stuck in the past, and it can be incredibly hard to look for a minor grant for operational costs to redo a website, hire a part-time executive assistant, etc. A relatively small grant can help them rebrand so as to have greater reach and impact.</p><h3><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3><p>What started out as a short essay ended up being much longer than I expected. But I hope there are many ideas throughout about how to promote good science and do high-impact philanthropy.</p><p>One grantee wrote to me:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cThat grant was a real accelerator. The flexibility (which flows from trust, and confidence, in a funder) was critical in being able to grow, and do good work. It also helped set my expectations high around funders being facilitative rather than obstructive (possibly too high\u2026). I think clueful funding is critical, I have seen funders hold projects and people back, not by whether they gave money, but how they gave it, and monitored work afterwards.\u201d</p></blockquote><p>To me, that captures the best of what philanthropy can do. Find great people, empower them with additional capital, and get out of their way.</p><p>By contrast, government funders make grants according to official criteria and procedures. Private philanthropy often acts the same way. As a result, there aren\u2019t enough opportunities for innovative scientists or metascientists to <a href=\"https://goodscience.substack.com/p/why-science-funders-should-try-to\"><u>get funding for their best ideas</u></a>.</p><p>My own success as a metascience VC would have been far less if I had been forced to project a high expected-value for each grant. Indeed, such a requirement would have <i>literally</i> ruled out many of the <i>highest-impact</i> grants that I made (or else I would have been forced to produce bullshit projections).</p><p>The paradox is that the highest-impact work often <i>cannot</i> be predicted reliably in advance. Which isn\u2019t that surprising. As in finance, the <i>predictable</i> activities that might lead to high impact are essentially priced into the market, because people and often entire organizations will already be working on those activities (often too much so!).</p><p>If you want to make additional impact <i>beyond</i> that, you\u2019re left with activities that <i>can\u2019t</i> be perfectly predicted and planned several years in advance, and that require some insight beyond what most peer reviewers would endorse.</p><p>What\u2019s the solution? You have to rely on someone\u2019s instinct or \u201cnose\u201d for smelling out ideas where the only articulable rationale is, \u201cThese people seem great and they\u2019ll probably think of something good to do,\u201d or \u201cNot sure why, but this idea seems like it could be really promising.\u201d In a way, it\u2019s like riding a bicycle: it depends heavily on tacit and unarticulable knowledge, and if you tried to put everything in writing in advance, you would just make things worse.</p><p>Both public and private funders should look for more ways for talented program officers to hand out money (with few or no strings attached) to people and areas that they feel are promising. That sort of grantmaking might never be 100% when it comes to public funds at NIH or NSF, but maybe it could be 20%, just as a start. I suspect the results would be better than today, if only by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher%27s_fundamental_theorem_of_natural_selection\"><u>increasing variance</u></a>.</p>", "user": {"username": "Stuart Buck"}}, {"_id": "ofC5eL88bC5Thjxoy", "title": "Summary of \u201cThe Precipice\u201d (2 of 4): We are a danger to ourselves", "postedAt": "2023-08-13T23:53:14.985Z", "htmlBody": "<p><i>This post is the second part of my summary of &nbsp;</i><a href=\"https://www.bloomsbury.com/uk/precipice-9781526600219/\">The Precipice</a>,<i> by Toby Ord.

What about our track-record of anthropogenic (human-caused) risks? It has been less than&nbsp;3&nbsp;centuries since the Industrial Revolution and less than a century since the invention of nuclear weapons, so our track record is compatible with a&nbsp;50% risk per century. Instead of looking at this track record, we need to look at the details of these risks.</p><p>Thanks for reading Million Year View!

They only had minutes to respond before the bulk of their own missiles would be destroyed by the incoming strike. When they checked the raw data from the early-warning systems, they realised that there was no attack, and a realistic simulation of a Soviet attack had accidentally been streamed to their system (Brezhnev, 1979; Gates, 2011; Schlosser, 2013).</p><p>Cold War tensions led us astonishingly close to nuclear war over&nbsp;32&nbsp;times (US Department of Defense, 1981). What would happen if a nuclear war occurred? The worst-case scenario is an all-out nuclear exchange between two countries with many nuclear weapons, such as the US and Russia. This would kill tens or even hundreds of millions of people in the cities hit by the bombs. Radioactive dust would be blown outward, spreading deadly radiation. Smoke from the burning cities would darken the skies, block out the sun, and cool the earth.</p><p>This would be unlikely to result in extinction. Most people living outside of major cities in the countries that were bombed would survive the initial blast; the blasts wouldn\u2019t produce enough radioactive dust to make the entire earth inhospitable. The worst effects would be from the darkening of the sky and the ensuing nuclear winter. Our best models suggest that the growing season might be too short for most crops, in most places, for five years (Robock, Oman &amp; Stenchikov, 2007). Billions of people would be at risk of starvation, but humanity would likely survive by growing less efficient crops, building greenhouses, fishing, and perhaps even farming algae.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefn4d67kmdg4\"><sup><a href=\"#fnn4d67kmdg4\">[1]</a></sup></span></p><h1>Climate change</h1><p>Carbon dioxide, together with water vapour and methane, creates a kind of gaseous blanket around Earth. This is essential for life (without it, Earth would be a frozen wasteland). Since the Industrial Revolution, we have burned fossil fuels and rapidly increased the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere from about&nbsp;280&nbsp;parts per million to&nbsp;412&nbsp;parts per million in&nbsp;2019 (Lindsey, 2018; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, 2019). Unless we significantly reduce emissions, this will quickly warm the planet. While this probably won\u2019t be the end of humanity, there is substantial uncertainty about how much we might emit and what effect it will have.</p><p>The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (2014) estimates that a fourfold increase from preindustrial carbon dioxide levels has a two-thirds chance of warming&nbsp;Earth between 1.5&nbsp;and&nbsp;9&nbsp;degrees Celsius (and therefore a one-third chance of warming above&nbsp;9&nbsp;degrees or below&nbsp;1.5&nbsp;degrees). This is before considering feedback loops, such as increased bushfires, which release additional carbon, and the melting of ice which contains trapped greenhouse gases. This leaves us with a substantial chance of very significant warming. Even though it would be an unprecedented disaster, and this is reason enough to stop emissions, even&nbsp;20&nbsp;degrees of warming would leave many coastal areas habitable all year round.</p><p>One particularly bad feedback loop involves increased temperatures evaporating water in the oceans, creating a denser blanket of water vapour around Earth and accelerating warming.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefgcnk3ml39pu\"><sup><a href=\"#fngcnk3ml39pu\">[2]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Though current research suggests such an effect would not be strong enough to entirely evaporate the ocean, and probably won\u2019t happen at all, we cannot rule it out. While this is the only known mechanism for climate change to cause the extinction of humanity, there may be unknown mechanisms, and given that Earth has never seen such a rapid period of warming, we have substantial uncertainty about the eventual effects.</p><h1>Environmental damage</h1><p>The world\u2019s population grew ever faster between&nbsp;1800&nbsp;and 1968. Seeing this, Paul Ehrlich predicted that in the coming decades this growing population would become unsustainable and there would be \u201can utter breakdown of the capacity of the planet to support humanity.\u201d<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefkxnatb4fuk\"><sup><a href=\"#fnkxnatb4fuk\">[3]</a></sup></span></p><p>Because of improvements in agriculture and slower population growth, this breakdown has not yet happened, and the global population is expected to peak at&nbsp;11&nbsp;billion. This is still many more people than Earth has ever supported, and as people grow in material wealth, the per-person strain on the environment increases beyond what it ever was. Does this present an existential risk?</p><p>Resource depletion is unlikely to present any real risk to our potential.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefow2a3g1ug1\"><sup><a href=\"#fnow2a3g1ug1\">[4]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;A bigger threat is biodiversity loss. Some suggest we are witnessing the next mass extinction. While it is difficult to compare current extinction rates with the fossil record, current species loss appears to be both much smaller (1% of species versus at least&nbsp;75%) and much faster (10 to&nbsp;100&nbsp;times faster) than previous mass extinctions. From the perspective of humanity\u2019s survival, the most important thing is that ecosystems do not break down so far that they stop providing vital services such as purifying water, providing energy and resources, improving our soil, and creating breathable air. These risks are not well understood, and if we continue to put enormous pressure on our environment this century, this may result in large, currently unforeseen risks.</p><h1>Emerging pandemic risk</h1><p>From 1347 to 1353, between one-quarter and one-half of Europeans were killed by plague (Ziegler, 1969). After World War I, the&nbsp;1918&nbsp;flu (also known as Spanish flu) spread to six continents, infected over a third of the world\u2019s population, and killed more people than the war (Taubenberger &amp; Morens, 2006). Neither of these events was devastating enough to end humanity, or even collapse civilisation, and we would likely recover from a pandemic on a similar scale. We can also infer from the fossil record that, like other natural risks, the risk from a <i>natural </i>pandemic must be incredibly low.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefso42f5gblng\"><sup><a href=\"#fnso42f5gblng\">[5]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;However, improvements in biotechnology mean that we face a substantial new risk from <i>engineered </i>pandemics.</p><p>One risk comes from well-intentioned scientists trying to study viruses. Although most of this research poses no danger to humanity, a few experiments involve trying to give viruses new abilities \u2014 for instance, making them more deadly or transmissible.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnreftfpvbxttc6t\"><sup><a href=\"#fntfpvbxttc6t\">[6]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;While these experiments take place in the highest-security labs, there have been multiple leaks of deadly pathogens such as smallpox (1971&nbsp;and&nbsp;1978) and anthrax (1979&nbsp;and&nbsp;2015). This is particularly worrying because these labs lack transparency and we very likely do not know about all of the leaks.</p><p>There is also the threat of misuse. Fifteen countries are known to have developed bioweapons programs at some point in the last century. The largest program was in the Soviet Union, with a dozen labs employing&nbsp;9,000&nbsp;scientists to weaponise diseases like plague and smallpox.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefn806ghs7fu8\"><sup><a href=\"#fnn806ghs7fu8\">[7]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;That we have seen few deaths from bioweapons so far, compared to natural pandemics, is not as reassuring as it first appears. Deaths from war follow a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_law\">power-law</a> distribution where most deaths occur in just a few very large wars and most wars kill far fewer people; if this is the case with biological risks, then the risk might be quite high despite few deaths so far.</p><p>Biotechnology is also increasingly democratised. It took 13 years from \u2014 1990 to 2003 \u2014 and over $500&nbsp;million to produce the full DNA sequence of the human genome. In 2019 it cost less than $1,000&nbsp;and took less than an hour. While this trend will result in fantastic applications of this technology to improve our lives, over the coming century it will also give people increasing access to dangerous pathogens.</p><p>There are clear efforts to reduce these risks, but more is needed. For instance, the Biological Weapons Convention of&nbsp;1972&nbsp;is monitored by just four employees with a budget smaller than an average McDonald\u2019s restaurant.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefj3ofrecbz4d\"><sup><a href=\"#fnj3ofrecbz4d\">[8]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;And while many companies that synthesize DNA are careful to ensure that pathogens don\u2019t fall into the wrong hands, perhaps only&nbsp;80% of their orders are screened for dangerous pathogens (DiEuliis, Carter &amp; Gronvall, 2017).</p><h1>Artificial intelligence</h1><p>Initially, AI dominated tasks that were previously thought to require our unique human intelligence, such as chess. But progress was faltering and slow on seemingly simple tasks, such as recognising a dog versus a cat. Now, AI can do many of these tasks \u2014 for instance, recognising faces better than a human.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref00zle1s9uu1j\"><sup><a href=\"#fn00zle1s9uu1j\">[9]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Experts even find it plausible that we could invent a fully general artificial intelligence this century; a&nbsp;2016&nbsp;survey of researchers who had published in NeurIPS and ICML indicated that the average respondent gave this a&nbsp;50% chance by&nbsp;2061 (Grace et al., 2018).</p><p>Chimpanzees are not going to decide the fate of the world, or even the fate of chimps. Instead, we get to decide, because we are the most intelligent and technologically advanced species. In the absence of other evidence, we should expect that losing our position as the most intelligent species would be a big deal (and perhaps not one that will favour humans).</p><p>Importantly, ensuring that AI is aligned to human values appears to be a difficult and unsolved problem. The methods we have for producing intelligence tend to either involve letting a human decide on a reward function and then training a neural network to act in ways that produce greater rewards or letting an AI observe human choice and infer a reward system based on this. But humanity\u2019s values are too complex and subtle to write down as a simple formula, and we do not know how to guide an AI system to learn them.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref19luck1fz24\"><sup><a href=\"#fn19luck1fz24\">[10]</a></sup></span></p><p>Initially, we may have the option to turn off an AI system. But over time, these systems will likely become resistant to this. Indeed, to maximise their reward function they must survive and thwart our attempts to bring their reward function in line with human values. Ultimately, an AI system is incentivised to take control of resources and shape the world \u2014 wresting control from humans. Since humans would predictably interfere with these goals, it would also be incentivised to hide its true goals until they are powerful enough to resist our attempts to stop them.&nbsp;</p><p>Contrary to Hollywood blockbusters, AI would not need robots in order to gain control. The most powerful figures of history were not the strongest; Hitler, Stalin, and Genghis Khan used words to convince millions to fight their battles. AI could well do the same. Even if many humans are left alive, this could permanently destroy humanity\u2019s potential \u2014 and thus be an existential catastrophe.</p><h1>Dystopian scenarios</h1><p>We could lose humanity\u2019s potential by letting the world become locked into a permanent state of little value. The most obvious scenario is permanent authoritarian rule made possible by advances in technology for detecting and eliminating dissent.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefslzamoq7wa\"><sup><a href=\"#fnslzamoq7wa\">[11]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Even if there was a slim chance that we were able to recover, an event like this could destroy most of our potential. There is little such risk in the near future, but as technology improves, this may change.</p><p><i>The next post in this series will tie everything together with an overview of the risk landscape, including quantitative estimates of the risk from nuclear war, climate change, pandemics, and artificial intelligence.&nbsp;</i></p><h1>Sources</h1><p>Biological Weapons Convention Implementation Support Unit (2019). <a href=\"https://geneva-s3.unoda.org/static-unoda-site/pages/templates/the-biological-weapons-convention/topics/2019-0131%2B2018%2BMSP%2BChair%2Bletter%2Bon%2Bfinancial%2Bmeasures.pdf\">Biological Weapons Convention\u2014Budgetary and Financial Matters.</a></p><p>Diane DiEuliis, Sarah R.

There are open source models (most notably <a href=\"https://ai.meta.com/llama/\">Llama</a>) out there, but many of the most popular systems like <a href=\"https://openai.com/gpt-4\">GPT-4</a>, <a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/product\">Claude</a>, and <a href=\"https://stability.ai/stablediffusion\">Stable Diffusion</a>, are proprietary pieces of software meant for consumer or commercial use. <a href=\"https://openai.com/product\">OpenAI</a> and <a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/product\">Anthropic</a> actually list their models as \u201cProduct\u201d on their website.</p><p>If AI systems are products, then it seems valuable to understand how we currently regulate consumer goods to make sure they are safe for public use.</p><p>This post looks at the <a href=\"https://www.cpsc.gov/\">Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC)</a>, an <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_agencies_of_the_United_States_government\">independent agency</a> that regulates consumer product in the US. CPSC focuses on addressing \u201cunreasonable risks\u201d of injury (through coordinating recalls, evaluating products that are the subject of consumer complaints or industry reports, etc.); developing uniform safety standards (some mandatory, some through a voluntary standards process); and conducting research into product-related illness and injury.</p><p>In particular, I focus on the <a href=\"https://www.cpsc.gov/Business--Manufacturing/Testing-Certification\"><u>testing and certification</u></a> that the CPSC requires, which seems especially useful for thinking about how to govern AI.</p><hr><h3><a href=\"https://www.cpsc.gov/Business--Manufacturing/Business-Education/childrens-products\">Childen\u2019s products</a></h3><ul><li>Children\u2019s products are subject to the strictest testing/certification process</li><li><a href=\"https://www.cpsc.gov/Business--Manufacturing/Testing-Certification/Third-Party-Testing/Initial-Testing\"><u>Initial certification testing</u></a>: every domestically-produced and imported children\u2019s product must be tested by a third party, CPSC-approved laboratory before it can be sold<ul><li>Over&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cpsc.gov/Business--Manufacturing/Testing-Certification/Lab-Accreditation\"><u>400 CPSC-accredited labs</u></a> around the world are authorized to test for different types of products</li><li>The manufacturer or importer is responsible for getting the test done and issuing a \u201cChildren\u2019s Product Certificate\u201d [more below]</li></ul></li><li><a href=\"https://www.cpsc.gov/Business--Manufacturing/Testing-Certification/Third-Party-Testing/Component-Part-Testing\"><u>Component part testing</u></a>: if the component(s) of a product have already been third-party tested/approved, these can be accepted as proof of the product\u2019s safety/compliance</li><li><a href=\"https://www.cpsc.gov/Business--Manufacturing/Testing-Certification/Third-Party-Testing/Material-Change-Testing\"><u>Material Change Testing</u></a>: If there has been a material change to a children\u2019s product, the manufacturer/supplier is required to either retest the product or retest the component part that was changed to check for compliance with those rules affected by the material change<ul><li>Manufacturer/supplier must then issue a new Children\u2019s Product Certificate based on the new passing test results</li></ul></li><li><a href=\"https://www.cpsc.gov/Business--Manufacturing/Testing-Certification/Third-Party-Testing/Periodic-Testing\"><u>Periodic Testing</u></a>: third-party testing must continue to be conducted while a children\u2019s product is being produced<ul><li>Testing must be conducted at a minimum of 1-, 2-, or 3-year intervals, depending upon whether the manufacturer has a periodic testing plan, a production testing plan, or plans to conduct continued testing using an accredited laboratory</li></ul></li><li><a href=\"https://www.cpsc.gov/Testing-Certification/Childrens-Product-Certificate-CPC\"><u>Children\u2019s Product Certificate</u></a><ul><li>No standardized format: simply written in a word doc or equivalent</li><li>CPC must physically \u201caccompany\u201d the product or shipment of products covered by the certificate; manufacturers/importers must also \u201cfurnish\u201d the GCC to distributors/retailers</li><li>If you sell directly to consumers, the certificate does not need to be provided to the consumer</li><li>You do not need to file your certificate with the government or any other regulatory body in the US; however, the CPSC can request a copy of your certificate at any time, and it must be supplied in such cases</li><li>It is a violation of the CPSA to fail to furnish a CPC and to issue a false CPC; a violation could lead to a civil penalty, criminal penalties, and asset forfeiture</li><li>Required elements<ul><li>Identification of the product covered by the certificate<ul><li>Describing the product(s) in enough detail to match the certificate to each product it covers and no others</li></ul></li><li>Citation to each CPSC children\u2019s product safety rule to which the product is being certified<ul><li>The certificate must identify separately each children\u2019s product safety rule that is applicable to the children\u2019s product</li></ul></li><li>Identification of the importer or domestic manufacturer certifying compliance of the product<ul><li>Provide the name, full mailing address, and phone number of the importer or US domestic manufacturer certifying the product</li></ul></li><li>Contact information for the individual maintaining records of test results<ul><li>Provide the name, full mailing address, e-mail address, and phone number of the person maintaining test records in support of the certification</li></ul></li><li>Date and place where this product was manufactured<ul><li>For the date(s), provide at least the month and year.

It\u2019s rather the opposite for me. I need to say that my time organizing EA ENS was very enjoyable.

See \u201cMood Timeline\u201d at the end for more details.</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Introduction</h3><p>I wanted to lead an EA group in my university. I looked up many of the resources that existed. And here, implicitly, a model appeared in my head:&nbsp;<i>L</i>o<i>ok up resources. Choose which one to apply. Apply. Result: EA Group</i>. Easy!</p><p>This model proved wrong. I wasn\u2019t&nbsp; living in a university which was very similar to prestigious English-speaking universities. A thus [potentially big] part of the community building advice sounded unconvincing, not applicable for some reason, or promised to fail. That's not because the advice was bad, but because the advice could not be universally applied \u2013 when it comes to building groups in different cultures, I felt I had some implicit knowledge that those who never interacted with it missed.</p><p>I came across what I first perceived was&nbsp;<i>a lot</i> of hurdles when trying to set up the EA Group of ENS Paris in 2022-2023 (I spent a full EAGx spamming other group organizers with my problems to get them sorted out). These hurdles weren't anticipated in the advice, and the aim of this post is to share my experience. Also, those constraints were fruitful, so I'm sharing with you a few of the ideas I had while adapting to what I felt was a particularly harsh environment.</p><p>For those who don't have time for the context, you'll find below a list of innovations that were worth trying:</p><ol><li>If you\u2019re non-English-speaking, choosing one\u2019s words wisely, not translating literally.</li><li>Doing projects, at least for one semester.</li><li>If you can't run a fellowship because no one wants, considering it ok, and doubling sessions instead.</li><li>Recruiting outside one\u2019s core institution.</li><li>You might need to distinguish yourself from other orgs by restricting your activities.</li><li>During presentations, doing workshops.</li><li>Teaching people&nbsp;<a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20190531235100/https://streetepistemology.com/publications/street_epistemology_the_basics\"><u>Street Epistemology</u></a> <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/D2GrrrrfipHWPJSHh/book-review-how-minds-change\">&amp; co</a> (insist on consent and transparency)&nbsp;</li><li>Knowing whether your university is searching for a paid impact career adviser.</li></ol><p>But further than this, the aim of this post is also to share that being a group organizer means facing unexpected challenges, being confused, seeking help, talking to people, and testing solutions. Your particular obstacles may be very different, and it\u2019s also okay to feel like no one has been there before.</p><h3>Problem 1: Fran\u00e7ais don't like English.</h3><p>That's something European group organizers are starting to discuss, but there is a general feeling that France, Italy, and Spain (and possibly Portugal) have a higher rate of \u201chostility by default\u201d when it comes to EA. These are countries where the term \u201cutilitarianism\u201d has, in popular thought, a clearly negative connotation.</p><p>There are several ways of explaining this: a hostility to English and therefore ideas coming from the anglosphere, a strong sense of national intellectualism, maybe a higher influence of continental philosophy, an influence of Vatican II / social Catholicism, more non-liberal progressives, what have you.</p><p>This stressed me when presenting the EA club. My main concern was to avoid misrepresentation, since I had the experience of people usually misunderstanding a lot of core concepts within EA due to the cultural shift. To give you some examples, these are a few of the phrases and words I'd never use, because of the typical misunderstandings it creates:</p><ol><li>Maximizing</li><li>Objectivity</li><li>Critical Thinking</li><li>Moral</li><li>Good, Bad</li><li>Utilitarianism</li><li>Coaching</li></ol><p>My basic pitch for presenting EA, instead of \u201cMaximizing your impact\u201d or \u201cDoing good better\u201d would rather be \u201cImproving the world as much as possible by relying on reason, evidence and philosophy\u201d. I'd then usually say that, given the method at hand, I was talking about analytic philosophy. I wouldn't talk about \u201cCareer Coaching\u201d, but \u201caccompanying you for your career choices, by getting to know your sincere desires and adding some rationality to the mix\u201d.</p><p>We also decided early on, before having me work on it part-time, to remove donations entirely from our discussion. This is tricky, you have to end up explaining a few concepts with new frameworks, not to speak of giving games. Most guides advised us to focus on career orientation, and we thought talking about money would only breed misrepresentation. In hindsight, we did particularly well, since even without discussing it, some people thought we were the club of \u201cweird people giving money to the poor in Africa\u201d.</p><p>This didn't prevent some people from assuming we were utilitarians in the misrepresented sense, or big followers of Peter Singer (notably, Singer has a very mixed reputation in France, even among animal rights activists, and is sometimes depicted as being ableist). This usually made me anxious as, in some sense, most of us&nbsp;<i>did</i> read writings by Peter Singer and agree with part of it, but it's not a prerequisite to agree with him. In short, I wouldn't get worried if most EA club members turned out not to be utilitarians or disagreed with big parts of Singer's thinking. What counts for me is them questioning rationally their way of improving the world and engaging in it.</p><p>People's intuitive black-and-white thinking was relatively hard to overcome, and it did cause some confusion to have me say \u00ab you don't have to agree with Singer \u00bb&nbsp;<i>and</i> having&nbsp;<i>Practical Ethics</i> inside the student library in the EA club bookcase.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Problem 2: I didn\u2019t [want to?] attend&nbsp;<a href=\"https://centreforeffectivealtruism.notion.site/University-Group-Accelerator-Program-6df8c8fccf8b4ffbb6488d9dfa275282\"><u>UGAP</u></a>&nbsp;</h3><p>I'm thankful I was accompanied by Guillaume V. from EA France and Simon Dima, my main group co-organizer. None of them had led an EA club in France before, and the last person to have done so was taking a year off from EA-related activities for their own wellbeing and for focusing on their studies. The initial founders of the club were also pretty busy.</p><p>This is a bit of a blurry step. I attempted to attend&nbsp;<a href=\"https://centreforeffectivealtruism.notion.site/University-Group-Accelerator-Program-6df8c8fccf8b4ffbb6488d9dfa275282\"><u>UGAP</u></a>, and some communication problems made me miss the starter program, and probably thus the program propper. Discussing with several people, including Joris Pijpers, got me to realize however that, given the hurdles I'm describing here (and probably my own approach), a UGAP mentor was probably not a good fit for me (80% confidence) nor for French group organizers in general (70% confidence). If I were to be told how to run a fellowship, it would indeed have turned out mostly useless (see paragraphs underneath for explanations). I\u2019d rather not advise anyone however&nbsp;<i>not</i> to attend UGAP, because the counterfactual is, again, very blurry for me.</p><p>That also meant I&nbsp;<i>was</i> alone. I did attempt to contact people whose main problem would also be \u201cadapting to a different culture\u201d, but I think I still felt confused about this at that time, and it didn\u2019t really help. The most interesting encounters I had on the topic were with people from EA Italia and someone who had French friends, but my efforts for meeting someone who\u2019d face the same challenges was rather met with failure.</p><h3>Problem 3: We're not a lot</h3><p>ENS is a ten-year state-paid program meant to form elite researchers and government officials. And despite that, we're not a lot. When I say \u00ab we \u00bb, I mean the \u00ab main reservoir \u00bb : ENS is in theory 4000 students total (400 students for every promotion), which means actually something like 2000 + a couple hundred externs and visiting students on site. Past their fifth year, students usually go abroad. In contrast, someone told me that the pool the Oxford EA club drew from was about 7000 students, while the webpage indicates something around 30000 (say, more realistically, 15000).</p><p>This implies that creating a group is hard. We can get students to come inside a classroom and talk about EA, but there won't be 8 of them, which is about the breakeven point to make people feel like they're in a group.</p><p>Solution? Recruiting within PSL, the \u201csuper-university\u201d hosting ENS Paris \u2013 something partially inspired from the efforts of Jelle D. This wasn't intuitive at first \u2013 the guides you'll find do not mention this option, but it really is one if needed. Universities aren't a single network \u2013 they're a web of networks who regularly meet inside the physical world as club fairs, parties, etc. Getting where the different networks meet is a good idea, it might not be that far off from where you are. I\u2019m planning on further extending the club next year, to ensure a stabler club and a nice group atmosphere.</p><p>This tactic allowed us to have 10 members total, getting us to an average of 4 or 5 members in each session. Ten, at least in a student club life in France, is still relatively fragile \u2013 in one or two sessions, only one person came.</p><p>How to account for that yet keep the club going?&nbsp;<i>Cozy Sessions</i>. Instead of going to the classroom we had booked, we simply sat in some couches near a blackboard and had a more informal version of the session. If there is only one person coming, that feels considerably less weird and more logical to do. You can even bring a boiler, some mugs, and make some tea! I also owe to Matthew R. the idea of focusing on a rolling average rather than the exact number of students, helping me to draw the outline of attendance during the year \u2013 there is a sharp fall in December and on the first week after the Christmas vacations.</p><h3>Problem 4: \u201cWhat do you do?\u201d</h3><p>Number one question while tabling. \u00ab We go rock-climbing ! \u00bb, \u00ab We sing internet memes a capella together ! \u00bb, \u00ab We do exclusively useless stuff ! \u00bb, every club has their own shtick. You need to have a concrete answer.&nbsp; Rabia A., GO at UCL, and Gidi Kadosh., lead of EA Israel whom I met at EAGxPrague, got me thinking early about this. But we didn't really have a clear answer \u2013 sure, we meet, we make presentations, we \u00ab think together \u00bb, we can pay for travel if needed (no one needed), we \u00ab have books \u00bb, we make projects, we accompany you for your career plan... Turns out the right answer to this social script was to add the room we met in, the hour we met at, and a couple of examples of what we did so far. Which we didn't have yet..</p><h3>Problem 5: \u201cWhat's the difference between\u2026\u201d</h3><p>A second problem is that we are not the only organization worrying about the kinds of stuff EA worries about. I won't name them and kindly ask you not to name them in the comments, but in short another organization drew on the previous year's HEAs in university for strategic purposes, and that organization, despite not being officially affiliated with EA, was, 'lo and behold, operating within ENS, amongst other. Which meant we had a potential overlap problem.</p><p>Surprisingly, the overlap in terms of audience wasn't very big. People attending the other org's activities were largely not attending the EA club meetings. The choice I made to clarify the difference was suggested to me by a Nordic organizer I met in EAGxBerlin 2022 -since we're the EA club, let's be&nbsp;<i>turbo-EA.&nbsp;</i>Argh, but remember. I have to be cautious of signaling within a different culture, shouting \u00ab glorious transhumanist future \u00bb everywhere around is probably not a good idea. Well, anyhow, doing X is not about displaying one's belonging to X-doers, it's about doing X well. And here it also meant being cautious with words, that's all.</p><p>So I planned to basically discuss almost all of the themes existing within the EA conversation and to insist on epistemics, instrumental rationality and ethics.</p><h3>Problem 6: Students don't have time</h3><p>We sent first-name emails when people didn\u2019t attend. This worked and proved crucial for the starting of our year: we had one session with zero people showing up. We sent an email individually to every single person on the mailing list, the 300 of them. Then eight people showed up. I think we should not send an email if the attendant lives near a group organizer. I think it\u2019s better to ask the said group organizer to politely get in touch, because it can seem a bit creepy (we had this feedback).</p><p>But of course that wasn't enough. Let's be turbo-EA except students don't have time \u2013 in a typical week, they won't have the time to read even a single 80k article in full, lest the Sequences. We even tried Rational Animation videos \u2013 it didn't work. Solution? No readings. No fellowships. Denser sessions. Repeat the sessions.</p><p>This worked. Having the same session twice a week was a very good idea for us. People did come if they were too busy on the default session, and mixed with the habit of replacing a \u201cstandard\u201d session with a \u201ccozy<i>\u201d&nbsp;</i>one, this becomes quickly useful and adaptive. We introduced the basics to everyone and, thanks to the students\u2019 ability to quickly absorb information, no one felt behind. One person who joined around March had a harder time, but they eventually caught up.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p><h3>Problem 7: The club can easily become uninteresting.</h3><p>Of course everything depends on what you're doing during the session itself. This is what I had to do (note that I sometimes recommend some of them to be more widely adopted within EA globally) :</p><p><strong>1 \u2013 Convey information</strong></p><p>That meant relying on a presentation \u2013 remember, readings were not read. I had to (re-)read all of the material on a subject matter, organize it mentally, make a nice presentation which was easy to follow, and cover in no time the most important material. I could afford to be very dense and technical since that\u2019s how most graduate education is in France.</p><p><strong>2 \u2013 Engage people</strong></p><p>Talking in front of a presentation is a nice idea, but it's not a nice idea if it's all there is to see. People have to be engaged, so I'd have them do some exercises, going from guessing the secret meta-ethics of someone to playing Eleusis. My presentations were scattered with small exercises of that kind.</p><p>Interestingly, this is one of the things that received the most positive feedback. Workshops are fun, and they ingrain skills in a better way than presentations do.</p><p><strong>3 \u2013 Let people debate</strong></p><p>I can't place myself as the source of all knowledge. Making presentations is considerably more okay in France than in other countries in terms of epistemic risks, since the \u201cteacher status\u201d still means one can be questioned or directly antagonized with, at least intellectually. But I wasn't sure that was enough to avoid epistemic deference, and so wanted to let people debate together. Remember I'm already spending most of the session presenting and organizing a workshop. I attempted to free 30 minutes at the end of each session to let everyone discuss.</p><p><strong>4 \u2013 Have people do stuff / develop skills</strong></p><p>Special thanks for Per Ivar F. on this one, who I talked to during the post EAGxBerlin organizer retreat.&nbsp;</p><p>Talking and thinking is nice. But actually doing stuff and getting new skills is the real goal of the club. My decision was simple: dedicate the entire second semester to projects. Well, hold on \u2013 students are usually bad at handing homework on time. I got to discuss with Alex C. from ENS (who is teaching a project-oriented class) and applied the following advice: at first, give them three weeks. Week 1: Find the project and its goal. Week 2: Do the project over the session's time. Week 3: Present the project.</p><p>That way, people were primed with finding doable tasks. The second round of projects had to do with their career, and they had already had some time to discuss it with me.</p><p>I also attempted something which ended up working poorly: most of the session was spent on object-level, but I would make regular pauses to have us think about what we were doing and whether that was the right way to do it. In hindsight, I think it might have proven more useful to have a different, more interactive form.</p><p><strong>5 \u2013 Help people argue better and have good epistemics</strong></p><p>I think good facilitation is not debating or formally scolding people for not being rigorous enough. I think it's about rephrasing what was just said by relying on the concepts we just saw, re-orienting the topic on point and moderating turn-taking. That's all. But that's already a bit hard to do consistently.</p><p>I highly recommend doing at least one Street Epistemology workshop to see what people think of it. My club was incredibly receptive and found it a rare opportunity to practice something they lack the mastery of. This, however, has to be done responsibly, Street Epistemology should not be understood as a way to secretly \u201cdebunk\u201d others belief, but an announced, transparent, and consented way to collaborate to get to the truth. I also did workshops on forecasting and epistemic rationality.&nbsp;</p><p>I think argumentation is a very important skill to master, and that a lot of EAs take it too trivially. Being a good rationalist is also about being able to talk to opponents and collaborate to get to the truth, and simply politely voicing the points you disagree with seems to me like a very bad strategy most of the time.</p><p>This, along with the concept of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/wkuDgmpxwbu2M2k3w/you-have-a-set-amount-of-weirdness-points-spend-them-wisely\"><u>Weirdness Points</u></a>, was also a way for me to attempt to control the group's reputation. Indeed, when someone at some point complained about the EA club existing (despite not interacting with us), the members had a good reaction and didn't engage in adversarial argumentation.</p><p><strong>6\u2013 Create a strong group</strong></p><p>Since they had no free time, members would rarely come to meet-ups, retreats, even less so EAG(x) events. You might say that socials have this precise role, but there was still something missing.</p><p>This thing was a feeling of contribution. I think presenting projects is important partly because of that, and that if anything, you should at least have one session of that kind during the year.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Someone was hiring</h3><p>We had planned to contact the university to discuss visibility at some point. I contacted the departments, as heavily suggested to me by Ram Eirik G. from EA Sussex, which sadly didn\u2019t get answers. We needed each and every of the 400 students of each class of ENS to know we existed, and that was a bit difficult. Since I was busy running the club for most of the year, we did it during the month of May, thinking about possibilities for September. We contacted several members of the administration \u2013 as directly suggested by someone during EAGxBerlin, including the delegate director for impact \u2013 whose existence was hardly foreseeable, but who does exist.<br>But it didn't turn out as expected. The \u201ccareer guidance\u201d office of the university (which we didn't know existed either) was searching for someone who'd be put in charge of high-impact careers. We considered the offer \u2013 if it wasn't me, it would probably be someone else, someone who is not aligned with EA values. It would create a slightly weird situation if the club\u2019s advising started conflicting with the official career advisors.</p><p>I took some time to think, layed out my plan and we made deals. I'll teach a seminar and have 1:1s with students following it, and doing additional career advising for the students asking for some. The club stays. The university pays me. I didn't conceal anything. The administration heard \u00ab Effective Altruism \u00bb, \u00ab no actual expertise on orienting students \u00bb and went \u00ab okay \u00bb. The only thing they want is me not refusing to orient a student, which sounds like good work ethics to me.</p><p><strong>Note: I don\u2019t think this is systematically a good idea to pursue</strong> \u2013 I think the EA Club has to stay important in case the seminar just leaves students bored and going through it for the credits. Here, the counterfactual influenced us, we estimated the impact it\u2019d have and how hard it would be to motivate students when career advising is already a given.</p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p><strong>A common pattern</strong></p><p>I\u2019ll conclude by pointing at a pattern I\u2019ve noticed while writing this post. Stuff usually goes this way :&nbsp;</p><ol><li>The Group Organizer resources suggest doing&nbsp;<i>X.</i><ol><li>Case 1:&nbsp;<i>X&nbsp;</i>seems fairly sensible and is done.<ol><li>&nbsp;No results.<i> X&nbsp;</i>mutates to take a new form or is given less weight.</li><li>Results.&nbsp;<i>X</i> may mutate to become more ambitious.</li></ol></li><li>Case 2:&nbsp;<i>X&nbsp;</i>seems fairly weird and bizarre.<ol><li>I don\u2019t do it, then meet someone who insist I do it, I argue, they argue then I do it or b.ii.</li><li>I try a softened, adapted version of&nbsp;<i>X&nbsp;</i>(go to a. Case 1)</li><li>I don\u2019t do it, then meet someone who insists I do it, I argue, they argue, I\u2019m unconvinced, I try b.ii.</li></ol></li></ol></li></ol><p><strong>What to advise ?</strong></p><p>Given the above description, I think that community building advice could potentially gain from an update (I\u2019m not a CB specialist, however, so take this with a grain of salt). This could be in personalizing the advice according to types of countries, or by finding some general rules aimed to adapt to a new terrain. In general, I think that a section insisting on creativity in case of the advice being ill-suited is important.</p><p>I\u2019d also like to hammer the fact that EA needs more social scientists, and not only ones who redact surveys, but ones who are ready to do several field observations, and have a strong background in studying cultural differences.</p><p>If anything, I think the only good response to constraints is creativity. If you feel that your environment is tricky, try new things. A lot of things will fail, but you will incrementally get to something that works, if you try again, differently, and talk your problems through with someone who listens and summarizes. It\u2019s still a prerequisite to stick to the goals and principles of EA while doing so, of course.</p><p>What is hard is that there isn\u2019t a clear \u201contology\u201d to play with, there isn\u2019t a collection of small parts that you can arrange in a different order, but this doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not solvable.&nbsp;</p><p><br>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Actual Community Building is Constant Fixing</strong></p><p>I\u2019m worried about doing bad CB.&nbsp;</p><p>There are tons of criticisms of different EA groups out there: your group can end up with <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/xomFCNXwNBeXtLq53/bad-omens-in-current-community-building\">bad epistemics</a>, poor meta-ethics, <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/euzDpFvbLqPdwCnXF/university-ea-groups-need-fixing\">lack of trust</a>, or even <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/LqjG4bAxHfmHC5iut/why-i-spoke-to-time-magazine-and-my-experience-as-a-female\">unethical behavior</a>. I think a bad heuristic to follow is to notice the criticisms, and then argue or mention them.</p><p>Rather, I think it is better to notice the criticism, evaluate it, then change the program accordingly, observe the result, <i>then</i> argue. I attempted to apply this all throughout this year.</p><p>A good community builder should not feel ashamed to update their processes in light of new criticisms. I think I attempted to take in account all credible criticisms of current CB I could find on the forum (according to my own credence) by changing the way I was \"doing\" EA. I have the general impression that there aren\u2019t a lot of group organizers doing that, and that most would rather add caveats while communicating. I think group organizers should not be afraid of answering to criticism with local reform, all the while avoiding to \u201cwater down\u201d EA. Yes, it\u2019s difficult, but it\u2019s also fun and a good opportunity to learn.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>[Annex : Mood Timeline]</h3><p><strong>September:</strong> Relatively Stressful, tabling is tiring. Sometimes, a bit of despair when the club was still trying to get stabilized, in case there wasn\u2019t enough attendants. I felt extremely relieved to discover the calendar tool for planning group organizer work. This is when peer support was extremely valuable. EAGxBerlin and the group organizer retreat also helped me gain motivation and insights on my main personal blocks.</p><p><strong>October:</strong> A bit stressful, I had succeeded to create a group but wasn\u2019t sure where to take it next. I was working on the theory of change and trying to make sure it made sense. I attented a CFAR workshop and the French national retreat which ultimately lead to me spending money more wisely (rather than never spending money) and to take my mental health even more seriously, despite these realisations being very (<i><strong>very</strong></i>) challenging. I think this is probably one of the best things that ever occurred to me so far.</p><p><strong>November: </strong>Happy, working on the sessions started to become easier.</p><p><strong>December:</strong> A bit worried, less attendants.</p><p><strong>January:</strong> Relieved, at that point the group really \u201clocked in\u201d.</p><p><strong>February:</strong> A bit more stressed as we were trying to shift onto projects and career advising. I had a very blurry program in my head.</p><p><strong>March:</strong> Progressively more happy as I was progressing on the career 1:1 and the projects were getting worked on.</p><p><strong>April:</strong> Same as march.</p><p><strong>May:</strong> A bit more stressed as I felt I needed to buckle up the 1:1s rapidly. I still think I started them a month too late.</p><p><strong>June:</strong> Less attendants, however those who missed sessions did come to catch up. EAGxWarsaw allowed me to realize what I had done and how far I had come to compared to last year.

It argues <a href=\"https://pubs.aip.org/physicstoday/article/61/12/37/393240/Environmental-consequences-of-nuclear-warA\">Toon 2008</a> has overestimated the soot ejected into the stratosphere following a nuclear war by something like a factor of 191<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefe3gwsu4uyc8\"><sup><a href=\"#fne3gwsu4uyc8\">[1]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;(= 1.5*2*2*(1 + 2)/2*(2 + 3)/2*(4 + 13)/2). I have not investigated the claims made in Bean's post, but that seems worthwhile. If its conclusions hold, the soot ejected into the stratosphere following the 4.4 k nuclear detonations analysed in <a href=\"https://pubs.aip.org/physicstoday/article/61/12/37/393240/Environmental-consequences-of-nuclear-warA\">Toon 2008</a> would be 0.942 <a href=\"https://www.nist.gov/pml/owm/metric-si-prefixes\">T</a>g<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefw5niuaes9ni\"><sup><a href=\"#fnw5niuaes9ni\">[2]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;(= 180/191) instead of \"180 Tg\". From Fig. 3a of <a href=\"https://pubs.aip.org/aip/acp/article/1596/1/65/591013/Environmental-consequences-of-nuclear-war\">Toon 2014</a>, the lower soot ejection would lead to a reduction in temperature of 0.2 \u00baC, and in precipitation of 0.6 %. These would have a negligible impact in terms of <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/food-security\">food security</a>, and imply the deaths from the climatic effects being dwarfed by the \"770 million [direct] casualties\" mentioned in <a href=\"https://pubs.aip.org/physicstoday/article/61/12/37/393240/Environmental-consequences-of-nuclear-warA\">Toon 2008</a>.</p><p>For context, Lu\u00edsa Rodriguez <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/pMsnCieusmYqGW26W/how-bad-would-nuclear-winter-caused-by-a-us-russia-nuclear\">estimated</a> \"30 Tg\" of soot would be ejected into the stratosphere in a nuclear war between the United States and Russia. Nevertheless, Lu\u00edsa notes the following:</p><blockquote><p>As a final point, I\u2019d like to emphasize that the nuclear winter is quite controversial (for example, see: <a href=\"https://science.sciencemag.org/content/227/4685/356.1\">Singer, 1985</a>; <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/475037b.pdf?origin=ppub\">Seitz, 2011</a>; <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/473275a\">Robock, 2011</a>; <a href=\"https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Nuclear-Winter-Responses-to-Nuclear-War-Between-the-Coupe-Bardeen/560033106c2d599bcace3ce4cb6c67d5b713ec50\">Coupe et al., 2019</a>; <a href=\"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1029/2019JD031281\">Reisner et al., 2019</a>; <a href=\"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/2016EF000415\">Pausata et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/2017JD027331\">Reisner et al., 2018</a>; Also see the summary of the nuclear winter controversy in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_winter#Criticism_and_debate\">Wikipedia\u2019s article on nuclear winter</a>). Critics argue that the parameters fed into the climate models (like, how much smoke would be generated by a given exchange) as well as the assumptions in the climate models themselves (for example, the way clouds would behave) are suspect, and may have been biased by the researchers\u2019 political motivations (for example, see: <a href=\"https://science.sciencemag.org/content/227/4685/356.1\">Singer, 1985</a>; <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/475037b.pdf?origin=ppub\">Seitz, 2011</a>; <a href=\"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1029/2019JD031281\">Reisner et al., 2019</a>; <a href=\"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/2016EF000415\">Pausata et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/2017JD027331\">Reisner et al., 2018</a>). I take these criticisms very seriously \u2014 and believe we should probably be skeptical of this body of research as a result. For the purposes of this estimation, I assume that the nuclear winter research comes to the right conclusion. However, if we discounted the expected harm caused by US-Russia nuclear war for the fact that the nuclear winter hypothesis is somewhat suspect, the expected harm could shrink substantially.</p></blockquote><p>As Lu\u00edsa, I <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/jBEyb8akFGzbADokR/future-benefits-of-mitigating-food-shocks-caused-by-abrupt\">have</a> <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/SZZdYwYvkJjus2vGp/increase-in-future-potential-due-to-mitigating-food-shocks\">been</a> <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/x2vELt7iwaZebHBEn/more-global-warming-might-be-good-to-mitigate-the-food\">assuming</a> \"the nuclear winter research comes to the right conclusion\", but I suppose it is worth bringing more attention to potential concerns. I have also not flagged them in my posts, so I am crossposting Bean's analysis for some balance.</p><h1>Nuclear Winter</h1><p>When I took a broad overview of <a href=\"https://www.navalgazing.net/Nuclear-Weapon-Destructiveness\">how destructive nuclear weapons are</a>, one of the areas I looked at was nuclear winter, but I only dealt with it briefly. As such, it was something worth circling back to for a more in-depth look at the science involved.</p><p>First, as my opponent here, I\u2019m going to take <a href=\"https://allianceforscience.cornell.edu/blog/2022/03/what-the-science-says-could-humans-survive-a-nuclear-war-between-nato-and-russia/\">What the science says: Could humans survive a nuclear war between NATO and Russia?</a> from the prestigious-sounding \u201cAlliance For Science\u201d, affiliated with Cornell University, and the papers it cites in hopes of being fair to the other side. Things don\u2019t start off well, as they claim that we\u2019re closer to nuclear war than any time since the Cuban Missile Crisis, which is clearly nonsense given <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Able_Archer_83\">Able Archer 83</a> among others. This is followed with the following gem: \u201cMany scientists have investigated this question already. Their work is surprisingly little known, likely because in peacetime no one wants to think the unthinkable. But we are no longer in peacetime and the shadows of multiple mushroom clouds are looming once again over our planet.\u201d Clearly, I must have hallucinated the big PR push around nuclear winter back in the mid-80s. Well, I didn\u2019t because I wasn\u2019t born yet, but everyone else must have.</p><p>Things don\u2019t get much better. They take an alarmist look at the global nuclear arsenal, and a careful look at the casualties from Hiroshima and Nagasaki, bombs vastly smaller than modern strategic weapons and with rather different damage profiles. Hilariously, their ignorance of the nuclear war literature extends to the point of ignoring fallout because there was relatively little fallout from those two airbursts, although it\u2019s well-known that groundbursts produce much more and are likely to be used in a modern nuclear war.</p><p>But now we get to the actual science, although before digging in I should point out that there are only a few scientists working on this area. The papers they cite include at least one of Rich Turco, Owen Toon or Alan Robock as an author, sometimes more than one. Turco was lead author on the original 1983 nuclear winter paper in <i>Science</i> and Toon was a co-author, while Robock has also been in the field for decades. The few papers I found elsewhere which do not include one or more of these three tend to indicate notably lower nuclear winter effects.</p><p>There are three basic links in the chain of logic behind the nuclear winter models here: how much soot is produced, how high it gets, and what happens in the upper atmosphere.</p><p>First, the question of soot production. <a href=\"https://physicstoday.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.3047679\">Environmental Consequences of Nuclear War</a>, by Toon, Robock and Turco gives the best statement of the methodology behind soot production that I\u2019ve found. Essentially, they take an estimate of fuel loading based on population density, then assume that the burned area scales linearly with warhead yield based on the burned area from Hiroshima. This is a terrible assumption on several levels. First, Hiroshima is not the only case we have for a city facing nuclear attack, and per <a href=\"https://www.atomicarchive.com/resources/documents/pdfs/effects/effects7.pdf\">Effects of Nuclear Weapons p.300</a>, Nagasaki suffered only a quarter as much burned area as Hiroshima thanks to differences in geography despite a similar yield. Taking only the most extreme case for burned area does not seem like a defensible assumption, particularly as Japanese cities at the time were unusually vulnerable to fire. For instance, the worst incendiary attack on a city during WWII was <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombing_of_Tokyo_%2810_March_1945%29\">the attack on Tokyo in March 1945</a>, when 1,665 tons of bombs set a fire that ultimately burned an area of 15.8 square miles, as opposed to 4.4 square miles burned at Hiroshima. To put this into perspective, Dresden absorbed 3,900 tons of bombs during <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombing_of_Dresden_in_World_War_II\">the famous firebombing raids</a>, which only burned about 2.5 square miles. Modern cities are probably even less flammable, as fire fatalities per capita have fallen by half since the 1940s.</p><p>Nor is the assumption that burned area will scale linearly with yield a particularly good one. I couldn\u2019t find it in <a href=\"https://nap.nationalacademies.org/read/940/chapter/4\">the source they cite</a>, and it flies in the face of all other scaling relationships around nuclear weapons. Given that most of the burned area will result from fires spreading and not direct ignition, a better assumption is probably to look at the areas where fires will have an easy time spreading due to blast damage, which tends to rip open buildings and spread flammable debris everywhere. per <a href=\"https://www.atomicarchive.com/resources/documents/pdfs/effects/effects3.pdf\">Glasstone p.108</a>, blast radius typically scales with the 1/3rd power of yield, so we can expect damaged area from fire as well as blast to scale with the yield<strong><sup>2/3</sup></strong>. Direct-ignition radius is more like yield<strong><sup>0.4</sup></strong>, so for a typical modern strategic nuclear warhead (~400 kT), this will overstate burned area by a factor of 2 for direct-ignition and a factor of 3 for blast radius.</p><p>And then we come to their targeting assumptions, which are, if anything, worse. The only criteria for where weapons are placed are the country in question and how much flammable material is nearby, and they are carefully spaced to keep the burned areas from overlapping. This is obvious nonsense for any serious targeting plan. 100 kT weapons are spaced 15.5 km apart, far enough to spare even many industrial targets if we apply more realistic assumptions about the burned area. A realistic targeting plan would acknowledge that many hardened military targets are close together and would have overlap in their burned areas, and that a lot of nuclear warheads will be targeted at military facilities like missile silos which are in areas with far lower density of flammable materials.</p><p>Their inflation of soot production numbers is clearly shown by their own reference 9, which is a serious study of smoke/soot production following an attack on US military assets (excluding missile silos) by 3,030 500 kT warheads. This team estimated that about 21 Tg of soot would be produced after burning an area similar to what Toon, Robock and Turco estimated would be burned after an attack by only 1000 100 kT weapons, which they claim would produce 28 Tg of smoke. They attribute this to redundancy in targeting on the part of the earlier study, instead of their repeatedly taking steps to inflate their soot estimates. They also assume 4,400 warheads from the US and Russia alone, significantly higher than current arsenals. Looking at their soot estimates more broadly, their studies consistently fail to reflect any changes from the world\u2019s shrinking nuclear arsenals. <a href=\"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2006JD008235\">A 2007 paper</a> uses 150 Tg as the midpoint of a set of estimates from 1990, despite significant reductions in arsenals between those two dates.</p><p>One more issue before we leave this link is that all fuel within the burned area is consumed. This is probably a bad assumption, given that Glasstone mentions that collapsed buildings tend to shield flammable materials inside of them from burning. I don\u2019t have a better assumption here, but it\u2019s at least worth noting and adding to the pile of worst-case assumptions built into these models.</p><p>But what about soot actually getting to high altitudes? After all, if the soot stays in the lower atmosphere, it\u2019s going to be rained out fairly quickly. Yes, the people downwind won\u2019t have a great time of it for a few days, but we\u2019re not looking at months or years of nuclear winter. As best I can tell, the result here is deafening silence. The only factor I can see at any point between stuff burning and things entering the upper atmosphere is a 0.8 in Box 1. Other than that, everything is going into the upper troposphere/stratosphere.</p><p>I am extremely skeptical of this assumption, and figured it was worth checking against empirical data from the biggest recent fire, the 2019-2020 Australian bushfires. These burned something like 400 Tg of wood<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref9ryhp0k4wzk\"><sup><a href=\"#fn9ryhp0k4wzk\">[3]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;which in turn would produce somewhere between 1.3 Tg and 4 Tg of soot based on <a href=\"https://www.uni-wuerzburg.de/fileadmin/07030400/Science-1990-Turco-166-76_1_globalNuclear.pdf\">a 1990 paper from Turco and Toon</a>, depending on how much the fires were like vegetation fires vs urban wood fires. Under the Toon/Robock assumptions, it sounds like we should have at least 1 Tg of soot in the stratosphere, but studies of the fires estimate between <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-020-00022-5\">0.4</a> and <a href=\"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2021GL092609\">0.9 Tg</a> of aerosols reached the stratosphere, with 2.5% of this being black carbon (essentially another term for soot). This suggests that even being as generous as possible, the actual percentage of soot which reaches the stratosphere is something like 2%, not 80%. The lack of climatic impact of the Kuwait oil fires, <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-94-011-1685-5_3?noAccess=true\">which released about 8 Tg of soot in total</a>, also strongly suggests that the relevant assumptions about soot transport into the upper atmosphere need to be examined far more closely. Robock attempts to deal with this by <a href=\"https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2006AGUFM.U14A..05S/abstract\">claiming that the Kuwait fires were too spread out and a larger city fire would still show self-lofting effects</a>. The large area covered by the Australian bushfires and the low amount of soot reaching the stratosphere calls this into question.</p><p>More evidence of problems in this area comes from <a href=\"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2018JD028922\">a paper by Robock himself</a>, attempting to study the effects of the firebombings in WWII. Besides containing the best sentence ever published in a scientific paper in its plain-language abstract<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnreftacbg4u2h4a\"><sup><a href=\"#fntacbg4u2h4a\">[4]</a></sup></span>, it also fails to find any evidence that there was a significant drop in temperature or solar energy influx in 1945. Robock tries to spin this as positively as he can, but is forced to admit that it doesn\u2019t provide evidence for his theory, blaming poor data, particularly around smoke production. I would add in potential issues around smoke transport. More telling, however, is that all of the data points to at most a very limited effect in 1945-1946, with no trace of signal surviving later, despite claims of multi-year soot lifetimes in the papers on nuclear winter.</p><p>Which brings us neatly to the last question, involving how long anything which does reach the stratosphere will last. <a href=\"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2019JD030509\">A 2019 paper from Robock and Toon</a> suggests that the e-folding life will be something like 3.5 years, while <a href=\"https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aax1748\">a paper published the same year and including both men as authors</a> has smoke from the 2017 Canadian wildfires persisting in the stratosphere for a mere 8 months, which they themselves noting that this is 40% shorter than their model predicted. They attempt to salvage the thesis here, even suggesting that organic smoke will contribute more than expected, but this looks to me like <a href=\"https://slatestarcodex.com/2015/11/21/reporter-degrees-of-freedom/\">reporting results different from what they actually got</a>. They attempt to salvage this by claiming that the smoke will reach higher, but at this point, I simply don\u2019t trust their models without a through validation on known events, and Kuwait is only mentioned in one paper, where they claim it doesn\u2019t count.</p><p>A few other aspects bear mentioning. First is the role of latitude. Papers repeatedly identify subtropical fires as particularly damaging, apparently due to some discontinuity in the effects of smoke at 30\u00b0 latitude which greatly increases smoke persistence. This seems dubious, given that Kuwait falls just within this zone, as does most of Australia, where the wildfires have yet to show this kind of effect. Second, all of the nuclear winter papers are short on validation data, usually pointing only to modeling of volcanic aerosols, which they themselves usually admit are very different from the soot they\u2019re modeling. There is generally no discussion of validation against more relevant data.</p><p>A few academic papers also call the Toon/Robock conclusion into question, most notably <a href=\"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2017JD027331\">this one</a> from a team at Los Alamos National Laboratory. They model one of the lower-end scenarios, an exchange of 100 15 kT warheads in a hypothetical war between India and Pakistan, which <a href=\"https://acp.copernicus.org/articles/7/1973/2007/\">Toon and Robock</a> model as producing 5 Tg of soot and a significant nuclear winter. This team used mathematical models of both the blast and the resulting fire, and even in a model specifically intended to overestimate soot production got only 3.7 Tg of soot, of which only about 25% ever reached above 12 km in altitude and persisted in the long term, with more typical simulations seeing only around 6% of the soot reaching that altitude. The other three-quarters stayed in the lower atmosphere, where it was rapidly removed by weather. This was then fed into the same climate models that were used by Robock and Toon, and the results were generally similar to earlier studies of a 1 Tg scenario, which showed some effect but nowhere near the impacts Robock predicted from the scale of the conflict. It\u2019s worth noting that these models appear to have significantly overestimated soot lifetime in the stratosphere, as shown by the data from the Canadian fire.</p><p>Robock <a href=\"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2019JD030777\">argued back against the paper</a>, claiming that the area it looked at was not densely populated enough, lowering the production of soot and preventing a firestorm from forming. The Los Alamos team <a href=\"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2019JD031281\">responded</a>, running simulations with higher fuel density that showed a strongly nonlinear relationship between fuel density and soot production, with a factor of 4 increase in fuel density doubling soot and a factor of 72 increasing soot production by a factor of only 6, as oxygen starvation limited the ability of the fire to burn. In both of these cases, the percentage of soot reaching an altitude where it could persist in the stratosphere was around 6%, and the authors clearly emphasize that their earlier work is a reasonably upper bound on soot production.</p><p>So what to make of all of this? While I can\u2019t claim a conclusive debunking of the papers behind nuclear winter, it\u2019s obvious that there are a lot of problems with the papers involved. Most of the field is the work of a tiny handful of scientists, two of whom were involved <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/42894446\">from its beginnings as an appendage of the anti-nuclear movement</a>, while the last has also been a prominent advocate against nuclear weapons. And in the parts of their analysis that don\u2019t require a PhD in atmospheric science to understand or a supercomputer simulation to check, we find assumptions that, applying a megaton or two of charity, bespeak a total unfamiliarity with nuclear effects and targeting, which is hard to square with the decades they have spent in the field<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefp1bxedl5ey9\"><sup><a href=\"#fnp1bxedl5ey9\">[5]</a></sup></span>. A tabulation of the errors in their flagship paper is revealing:</p><figure class=\"table\"><table><thead><tr><th style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>Error Factor</strong></th><th style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>Cause</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style=\"padding:0.34em;text-align:center\">1.5</td><td style=\"padding:0.34em;text-align:center\">Overestimating the number of warheads</td></tr><tr><td style=\"padding:0.34em;text-align:center\">2</td><td style=\"padding:0.34em;text-align:center\">Targeting for flammability rather than efficacy</td></tr><tr><td style=\"padding:0.34em;text-align:center\">2</td><td style=\"padding:0.34em;text-align:center\">Flammability for Hiroshima rather than normal city</td></tr><tr><td style=\"padding:0.34em;text-align:center\">1-2</td><td style=\"padding:0.34em;text-align:center\">Flammability for 1940s city instead of 2020s city</td></tr><tr><td style=\"padding:0.34em;text-align:center\">2-3</td><td style=\"padding:0.34em;text-align:center\">Linear burn area scaling</td></tr><tr><td style=\"padding:0.34em;text-align:center\">4-13</td><td style=\"padding:0.34em;text-align:center\">80% soot in the stratosphere vs 6%-20%</td></tr><tr><td style=\"padding:0.34em;text-align:center\">48-468</td><td style=\"padding:0.34em;text-align:center\">Total</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p>Even using the most conservative numbers here, an all-out exchange between the US and Russia would produce a nuclear winter that would at most resemble the one that Robock and Toon predict for a regional nuclear conflict, although it would likely end much sooner given empirical data about stratospheric soot lifetimes. Some of the errors are long-running, most notably assumptions about the amount of soot that will persist in the atmosphere, while others seem to have crept in more recently, contributing to a strange stability of their soot estimates in the face of cuts to the nuclear arsenal. All of this suggests that their work is driven more by an anti-nuclear agenda than the highest standards of science. While a large nuclear war would undoubtedly have some climatic impact, all available data suggests it would be dwarfed by the direct (and very bad) impacts of the nuclear war itself.</p><h1>Acknowledgements</h1><p>Thanks to Johannes Ackva for <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/x2vELt7iwaZebHBEn/more-global-warming-might-be-good-to-mitigate-the-food?commentId=2taRS3YJbe4ENBWju\">discussing</a> concerns around the nuclear winter literature, which increased my interest in the topic.</p><ol class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\"><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fne3gwsu4uyc8\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefe3gwsu4uyc8\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>Calculated multiplying the factors given by Bean in the last table, converting intervals to the mean between their lower and upper bound.</p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnw5niuaes9ni\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefw5niuaes9ni\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>1 Tg corresponds to 1 million <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonne\">tonnes</a>.</p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fn9ryhp0k4wzk\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnref9ryhp0k4wzk\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>Based on <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03712-y\">reported CO<strong><sub>2</sub></strong> emissions of 715 Tg</a> and a wood-to-CO<strong><sub>2</sub></strong> ratio of 1 to 1.8.</p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fntacbg4u2h4a\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnreftacbg4u2h4a\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>\u201cWe discovered that [the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki] was actually the culmination of a genocidal U.S. bombing campaign.\u201d</p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnp1bxedl5ey9\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefp1bxedl5ey9\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>A source I expect many of my readers will have looked at is <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/pMsnCieusmYqGW26W/how-bad-would-nuclear-winter-caused-by-a-us-russia-nuclear\">Luisa Rodriguez\u2019s writeup on nuclear winter</a> for Effective Altruism organization Rethink Priorities.

Additionally, there are up to 21 million Polish people living across the world. We love potatoes, onions, and dumplings with onions and potatoes.&nbsp;</p><h3><i>Quick Facts About EA Poland</i></h3><p>The first EA meetup we know of took place in 2014, and the first group was established in Cracow, in 2015. In 2018, the Polish Foundation for Effective Altruism (FEA) was registered. We have members from all over Poland: Cracow, Warsaw, Wroclaw, Poznan, Gdansk, Katowice, Lodz...</p><h2>Current status</h2><p>EA Poland in numbers:</p><ul><li>3 employees, with a total of 1.5 FTE (full-time equivalents; funded by the EA Infrastructure Fund)</li><li>~30 volunteers (incl. group organisers)</li><li>~60&nbsp;<a href=\"https://resources.eagroups.org/running-a-group/strategy/measurement-evaluation\"><u>highly-engaged EAs</u></a> \u2013 HEAs<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref1f922mgon2o\"><sup><a href=\"#fn1f922mgon2o\">[1]</a></sup></span>&nbsp; (incl. most of the volunteers)&nbsp;</li><li>178 members registered on our community Slack<ul><li>Of these, ~70 users are active on a weekly basis (figure 2)</li></ul></li><li>336 newsletter subscribers</li><li>Social media:<ul><li>2,700&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/fundacjaefektywnyaltruizm\"><u>Facebook fanpage</u></a> followers</li><li>1,100&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/384337268386742\"><u>Facebook group</u></a> members</li><li>515&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/efektywnyaltruizm/?hl=en\"><u>Instagram</u></a> followers</li><li>893&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/fundacjaefektywnyaltruizm/\"><u>Linkedin</u></a> followers</li><li>211&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@efektywnyaltruizm4265\"><u>YouTube</u></a> subscribers</li></ul></li></ul><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/vd325jctadGoL2F8s/izyehbzq1j0ekwwljnzf\"></p><ul><li>3 local groups (Warsaw, Cracow, Wroclaw)&nbsp;</li><li>1 active university group (University of Warsaw) and 1 university group expected to start in 2023/2024 (AGH in Cracow)</li><li>An online book club (we plan to publish a separate forum post about it)</li><li>2 AI Safety Groups (on-line): technical and governance</li><li>2 EA-aligned organisations (<a href=\"https://www.otwarteklatki.pl/\">Otwarte Klatki</a> [Anima International Poland] and <a href=\"https://www.optimumpareto.com/\">Optimum Pareto Foundation</a>)</li></ul><h2>What we did last year (June 2022 \u2013 June 2023)</h2><h3><i>Organisational Structure and Operations&nbsp;</i></h3><p>Over the course of the past year, we channelled a lot of effort into strengthening our organisational structure and operational capacity. This includes establishing basic processes and procedures in areas such as IT, finance, and legal; reintroducing Asana for task management; and revitalising our social media and newsletter. We collectively agreed to form an executive board where two Co-Directors represent FEA for a period of two years. After this period, re-election of the Co-Directors requires approval, granted by the Active Members via a vote. To evaluate and support the work of the Co-Directors, we have set up a Supervisory Board consisting of five HEAs, elected by the Active Members (employees, volunteers, interns, groups organisers, projects coordinators).</p><h3><i>Mission, Vision, and Strategy</i></h3><p>In 2022, we defined our strategy through a workshop and multiple group discussions. In November 2023, we will revise it and determine an action plan for the next two years. We intend to write a separate post on this topic.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h3><i>Organisational Culture&nbsp;</i></h3><p>Creating a safe and inclusive environment is a priority for EA Poland. We developed a <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mUdSLLq5jVT1ETDQ7xDWVd4okRR9xIAa/view\">Code of Conduct</a> through workshops, and introduced the Safety Person<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref8f9mxwnxxyg\"><sup><a href=\"#fn8f9mxwnxxyg\">[2]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;role to ensure the well-being and comfort of all community members. We also conducted a comprehensive survey to examine our organisational culture, with the aim of continuous improvement and fostering a supportive community. The survey, consisting of 72 questions, had an average score of 3.55 on a scale of 1-4, with 4 being highest. If you are interested in more specific information, let us know.</p><h3><i>Community Building</i></h3><p>To better understand the demographics of EA Poland, we held 1-1s with pretty much anyone in the community who was interested, and conducted a national survey in October 2022. 130 people filled it out, and you can read the analysis in Polish <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-6Pou1fEoaiLnueHlyLg4XC2YvExt2NA/view\">here</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>The data we acquired helped us determine that there seems to be enough people to attend an EAGx; which locations have the biggest potential to form local groups; which cause areas are of the biggest interest to the community members; and which individuals are eager to support our efforts.&nbsp;</p><p>To connect Polish EAs and create a space where they can help each other on the path to exerting positive impact, we \u2013 EA Poland\u2019s Active Members \u2013 have:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Organised the first&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2oWQx8N7pw&amp;ab_channel=EfektywnyAltruizm\"><u>EAGx conference in Poland</u></a>, Warsaw<ul><li>It was attended by a total of 250 attendees, including ~100 Polish community members of which ~10% constituted people who have not interacted with EA Poland before;</li></ul></li><li>Reactivated two local groups, in Cracow and Warsaw, seeded one in Wroc\u0142aw, and held several meetings in Pozna\u0144, \u0141\u00f3d\u017a, and Gda\u0144sk;</li><li>Officially registered a university group at the one of the country\u2019s largest and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://2023.ranking.perspektywy.org/ranking/university-ranking\"><u>best-ranked</u></a> university, University of Warsaw<ul><li>It has 6 coordinators, who are also active members of the wider EA community;</li></ul></li><li>Launched the national EA Intro Fellowship, which includes English-language resources alongside a Polish-language attendee handbook<ul><li>So far, we have had 2 editions \u2013 completed by 11 people in total \u2013 and the third edition started in July, with 13 more participants;</li></ul></li><li>Organised a three-day retreat attended by 24 Active Members;</li><li>Facilitated the establishment of the AI Technical Safety and AI Governance Groups which meet weekly and twice a month, respectively;</li><li>Facilitated online meetups every fortnight for Active Members;</li><li>Facilitated the online book club twice a month;</li><li>Organised two weekend-long events which included workshops and integration activities.</li></ul><p>Although we focused on getting to know and working with people who were already interested in EA, we accepted a number of invitations to participate in awareness-spreading projects, most notably by:</p><ul><li>Featuring on two podcasts:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/episode/5J3JC1VzJNyWfRVSFHwHFI?si=18eeeaf9b09f47c5\"><u>Otwarte Klatki [Anima International Poland]</u></a> and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/episode/7nSp6nzB1xNjQ6L4oSPGAI\"><u>Przemy\u015blane [Radio Luz]</u></a>;</li><li>Giving an interview to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://businessinsider.com.pl/lifestyle/efektywny-altruizm-czyli-pomaganie-wedlug-doliny-krzemowej/jlle6m6\"><u>Business Insider</u></a> (in Polish);</li><li>Attending conferences and events such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwUfNeL4CoI\"><u>Conference on Animal Rights in Europe (CARE)</u></a>, organised by Anima International;</li><li>Holding a 6-week-long EA intro workshop at&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AGH_University_of_Krakow\"><u>AGH University</u></a> in Cracow, for 20 sociology students and their professor. The workshop resulted in an offer to repeat it next year and to guest on the students\u2019 sociology podcast. Moreover, 4 members of the university\u2019s sociology club are eager to form an EA subsection.</li></ul><p>Additionally, members of our community have been involved in:</p><ul><li>The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/swn2yYoRxDXsKJAZd/last-call-for-eastern-european-community-leaders-to-apply\"><u>Eastern European Community Builders retreat</u></a>, held in Bratislava in November 2022;</li><li><a href=\"https://effisciences-research.notion.site/ML-for-Good-31-July-to-9-August-2023-950516f4ab0b44ca88457392875bb1ea\"><u>ML4Good</u></a>, held in August 2023;</li><li>The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aisafetyfundamentals.com/governance-course-details\"><u>AI Safety Fundamentals: Governance</u></a> course;</li><li>The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.trainingforgood.com/europe-tech-policy\"><u>EU Tech Policy Fellowship</u></a> (along with relevant internships in AI policy);</li><li>Changing their PhD studies to focus on impactful EA-aligned topics.</li></ul><h3><i>Research on Local Priorities&nbsp;</i></h3><p>In order to have a better understanding of the specific challenges and opportunities in our region, as well as possible effective interventions, we are running a research project about local priorities. The key focus is on Poland, since it\u2019s both one of the largest countries in the region and the one most familiar to us. The project is ongoing and is currently sifting through ideas in multiple stages, from an initial pool of over 300 ideas. Until we narrow down the list sufficiently to report on the absolute most promising interventions, please contact us if you are interested in our intermediary results.</p><h3><i>Launching an Effective Giving Platform</i></h3><p>Inspired by the work of other EA groups, for example in Norway and Germany, we created an effective giving platform called&nbsp;<a href=\"https://wiecejdobra.pl/\"><u>WiecejDobra.pl</u></a> (lit.&nbsp;<i>More Goodness</i>) to make effective giving more accessible in Poland. This is achieved by introducing the local language and local payment methods (e.g. BLIK); it is currently in its first version, with basic functionality. We are currently working with tax advisors to determine whether such a donation is tax deductible. Over the next few months, we will focus on two areas: further development of the platform and marketing for the wider community.</p><h2>What's next?&nbsp;</h2><h3><i>The Big Picture</i></h3><p>Based on our strategy workshops, EA Poland has established three key pillars for our activities: Community Building, Career Planning &amp; Project Incubation. The main responsibility for executing the strategy will be shared between the two EA Poland Co-Directors, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/maria-gembarzewska-truong\">Maria Gembarzewska-Truong</a> and <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/chris-szulc-v/\">Chris Szulc</a>, with significant support from Active Members.</p><p>Chris, with his prior experience in community building at EA Netherlands, continues to lead the Community Building pillar. Maria, with her extensive background in human resources, focuses on Career Planning. Project Incubation will be a focal point in Q4 2023, with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.wiecejdobra.pl/\"><u>WiecejDobra.pl</u></a> and Local Priorities Research already underway.</p><h3><i>Community Building</i></h3><p>From our perspective, EAGxWarsaw set a good deadline for focusing our efforts on the activities that helped us identify and engage the existing EAs and EA-aligned folks in Poland. We could then bring them together and let them experience what we have already discovered along the way: that our community is larger than it seemed on the surface, and its members are eager to rock.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Now, given our history of the community going somewhat dormant whenever its main organisers could no longer contribute to its development, we are adding two new sets of activities aimed at minimising the risk of such a scenario repeating itself:</p><ol><li>Supporting the new Community Builders\u2019 growth and ensuring the mechanisms facilitating the successions are in place.</li><li>Experimenting with field building. We assume that groups with shared interests (AI Safety, animal welfare, policy-making, etc.) are more likely to prevail, regardless of what is happening with the general community.</li></ol><p>Apart from the above, we are continuing with the activities that have proved to work well and that we deem important: providing support to our individual members and the existing groups; organising retreats, workshops, and other events; running Intro Fellowships; developing relationships within the third sector.&nbsp;</p><p>More details will follow after November, once we are done with our action plan for the coming two years.</p><p>In a perfect scenario, by 2025 we will set up autonomous and sustainable groups working on specific cause areas, while attracting new members who wish to explore how to do the most good they can.&nbsp;</p><h3><i>Career Planning</i></h3><p>We are in the process of determining the most effective direction for our career planning and talent development efforts. Ideas currently under consideration include: creating workshop scenarios for local and university groups; developing a short guide for our website; starting fellowships; or providing one-on-one career advisory services for professionals and highly engaged EAs. We will conduct research on these topics, starting in August 2023, to ensure that we use the best approach.</p><p>We have partnered up with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zwolnieni_z_Teorii\">Zwolnieni z Teorii (ZWZT)</a> [Exempt from Theory]. ZWZT is a non-profit organisation that organises the nationwide Zwolnieni z Teorii Olympiad, where high school students compete by creating projects tackling societal problems, developing competencies and skills for use in the workplace, and more broadly \u2013 such as project management, social entrepreneurship, problem solving and communication. ZWZT also works with teachers, who support young people during their projects, by providing lesson plans.</p><p>In the Polish EA community, we also have members who are finalists of the previous Olympiads. The last Zwolnieni z Teorii Finale (a celebration at the end of the edition) was attended by about 3,500 people.</p><p>Together, we will develop a lesson plan focused on career planning, and distribute it along with the 80,000 Hours book to the most socially-engaged teachers from the ZWZT database. We expect to reach around 250 teachers in the first round. The lesson plans will be ready by October/November 2023.&nbsp;</p><h3><i>Project Incubation</i></h3><p>This area requires some further planning, which will commence in Q4 2023.</p><p>We aim to streamline the incubation of projects, which will support all other activities of EA Poland \u2013 be it promotional, organisational, community building etc. \u2013 as well as projects which have the potential to directly help those in need, both on a global and local level (thanks to our local priorities research project, which we want to leverage).</p><p>We are thinking of:</p><ul><li>helping to match co-founders/coordinators with each other,</li><li>helping them with planning the project,</li><li>connecting them to EAs and other experts with relevant expertise, both in local and global communities,</li><li>connecting them to resources, such as programs, fellowships, relevant knowledge and know-how,</li><li>helping co-founders to get funding and promoting their projects,</li><li>providing assistance throughout the project as needed, etc.</li></ul><h3><i>Organisational Tasks</i></h3><p>In parallel to our strategic pillars, we are working on a number of organisational tasks:</p><p>a) Fundraising strategy: since July 2023, we are developing a fundraising strategy to increase the sustainability of our operations.</p><p>b) Communication strategy: we are finalising our communications strategy to optimise our outreach efforts and effectively communicate the principles of effective altruism. We will most likely target the wider audience via the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.wiecejdobra.pl/\"><u>WiecejDobra.pl</u></a> brand, while The Polish Foundation of Effective Altruism will focus on communicating with EA community members.</p><p>c) Policy on counteracting potential discriminatory and unwanted behaviour: in September 2023, we will complete the development of a policy aimed at promoting a safe and inclusive environment in our community. This document is more complex than the Code of Conduct, and it will focus on procedures to follow when difficult situations arise.</p><p>d) In order to optimise our daily work, we are developing a wiki, hosted on Notion, and a CRM (customer relationship management) system using Airtable, aimed at facilitating meaningful connections between our community members.</p><p>e) Following the same process as described by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/cTfEv6zAakfyxrbQu/ea-content-in-french-announcing-ea-france-s-translation?utm_source=Groups%20Newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=125d361481-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2022_01_12_05_48_COPY_04&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_7d52b2f96c-125d361481-319225037#Translation_Coordination_Initiative\"><u>EA France</u></a>, we have started to translate EA materials into Polish.

It appears that the surge in COVID-19 related papers has started to dwindle, seeming to decrease in 2022 compared to 2021. On the other hand, the interest in AI seems to grow. In 2022, there was a noticeable uptick in AI-related papers compared to previous years. It seemed to me that AI-related papers might even constitute around 50% of the papers I categorized as having existential risk potential in 2022, although this is a rough estimate as I lack access to categorized data.</p><p>Turning to a particular concern regarding a lack of representation of women (1 out of 25) in the list. It's unclear what precisely underlies this issue and how we can address it, but it's undoubtedly a problem. We need to improve this situation. The community should take steps to make it more welcoming and supportive for women to participate, persist, and excel. For instance, initiatives like mentoring programs specifically aimed at women in the context of existential risks could be a good option here.</p><p>I plan to revisit this project in a year's time and provide an update if the new data shows a significant shift from the one shown here.</p>", "user": {"username": "FJehn"}}, {"_id": "tuMYnG3ydRa3n6ecx", "title": "How useful is it to use a slavery/factory farming comparison as a decision making heuristic?

In this framing, Pivotal offers an opportunity for those students to use this time to research impactful and different questions about the future of humanity.</p><h2><strong>How can you help?</strong></h2><ul><li><a href=\"https://pivotalcontest.org/nominate-a-student?orn=eaforum\"><strong>Nominate your friend(s), family members or fellow students</strong></a><strong> to give them some of the tools they need to make a lasting positive impact on the world</strong></li><li><a href=\"https://airtable.com/appG3QOmImzUtNsdj/shrAO4MyIDfaoyr5g\"><strong>Apply to grade essays</strong></a><strong> if you want to engage with outside perspectives on long-term issues from students everywhere&nbsp;</strong>(and earn extra money)<strong>.</strong> We expect that those well-versed in the philosophy of the long-term future, AI safety, or policy will be a particularly good fit \u2014 though this opportunity is open to anyone, including students.</li><li><a href=\"https://airtable.com/appG3QOmImzUtNsdj/shrR2WcCDUMZhhkWK\"><strong><u>Share constructive feedback</u></strong></a><strong> </strong>there<strong>,</strong> through the comments, or by email at&nbsp;feedback@pivotalcontest.org; all are equally fine<strong>.</strong></li></ul><h2><strong>Acknowledgements</strong></h2><p>We are grateful for Open Philanthropy's financial support and Oxford University's Global Priorities Institute for their partnership and collaboration in organizing this contest.<br><br>Thanks to the following for their support and guidance: Luke Freeman, Peter McIntyre, Jamie Harris, Neha Singh, and the dozens of people that red-teamed our website and provided valuable feedback.</p>", "user": {"username": "SahebG"}}, {"_id": "sxKzgHQiW3kbzvMkN", "title": "Where are the EA-aligned financial advisors for major donors?", "postedAt": "2023-08-11T17:55:16.498Z", "htmlBody": "<p>Recently, I've been talking to a bunch of EAs who need help with financial planning.</p><p>Lots of financial advisors know how to maximize wealth.

In addition, 8.8% of responses referred to the \u2018Benefits\u2019 resulting from AI, in their explanation of why they disagreed with the statement. 5.0% of responses mentioned the theme that AI would be \u2018Not capable\u2019 of causing harm, typically based on claims that it would not be sentient or have emotions. In addition, 2.9% of responses were coded as mentioning the theme that fears about AI were \u2018Scifi\u2019.

I'm not the biggest fan of AI, but its not that serious</i>\u201d</li><li>\u201c<i>I disagree, because Al is not a big issue like nuclear war</i>\u201d</li><li><i>\u201cI think there are other higher priority tasks for the government\u201d</i></li><li>\u201c<i>It shouldn't be considered the same level as a priority as nuclear war and pandemics, those are really serious and [l]ife threatening issues. It is something worth considering the risks of but not to that extreme</i>\u201d</li><li>\u201c<i>I disagree because I think threats like pandemics and nuclear war are much more dangerous than AI taking over</i>.\u201d</li><li>\u201c<i>It's not nuclear war bad</i>\u201d</li><li>\u201c<i>[I]t is nothing compared to wars or pandemics</i>\u201d</li><li>\u201c<i>Pandemics and resource wars are much more realistic threats to our society as a whole</i>\u201d</li><li>\u201c<i>War and pandemics are a much bigger issue to the every day person than AI\u2026</i>\u201d</li></ul><p>The fact that respondents raised specific objections to the claim that mitigating AI risk is as serious a threat as nuclear war or pandemics raises the possibility that, despite disagreeing with this facet of the statement, they might nevertheless support action to reduce risk from AI.</p><p>This always raises a couple of points relevant to communicating AI risk:</p><ul><li>Comparisons to other major threats or cause areas might provoke backlash.&nbsp;<ul><li>This could be either because they highly rate these other causes or because the comparison does not seem credible. If so, then this effect would need to be weighed against possible benefits of invoking such comparisons (e.g. highlighting the scale of the problem to ensure that people don\u2019t misconstrue the claim as merely being that AI will cause less existential problems, such as job loss). That said, it is not clear from this data that this&nbsp;<i>is</i> happening. It is possible that respondents disagree with the&nbsp;<i>statement</i> because they do not agree that AI risk is comparable to the other causes mentioned, but that this does not lead them to be less persuaded that AI risk is a large concern in absolute terms.</li></ul></li><li>It is unclear how particular comparisons (such as those in the statement) are interpreted and this may matter for how people respond to such communications.<ul><li>People might interpret statements such as \u201cAI should be a priority&nbsp;<i>alongside&nbsp;</i>other societal-scale risks such as pandemics and nuclear war\u201d in a variety of different ways. Some might interpret this as claiming that AI is&nbsp;<i>just as</i> important as these other risks (and may object- for example, one comment noted \u201c<i>Not sure the risks are all equivalent</i>\u201d), while others might interpret it as claiming that AI is in roughly the same class as these risks, while still others might interpret the statement as merely suggesting that AI should be part of a general portfolio of risks more broadly. As this might influence how people respond to communications about AI (both how much they agree and how severe they take the threat to be), better understanding how different comparisons are received may be valuable.</li></ul></li></ul><p>That said, many comments also invoked causes other than those mentioned in the statement as part of their disagreement, with climate change being particularly commonly mentioned. In addition, a number of comments specifically invoked the&nbsp;<i>immediacy</i> of other threats as a reason to prioritise those over AI (related, in part to the \u2018Not yet\u2019 theme, which we mentioned often overlapped with \u2018Other priorities):</p><ul><li>\u201c<i>The change in environment will make us extinct&nbsp;<strong>way way sooner than AI</strong> could even begin to try to do.</i>\u201d</li><li>\u201c<i>I think&nbsp;<strong>the other risks are more pressing right now</strong>. AI resources should be diverted to climate change and social movements, but that won't happen</i>\u201d</li><li>\u201c<i>I dont agree its as important because&nbsp;<strong>its not something that is actively happening</strong> whereas the other situations are</i>\u201d</li><li>\u201c<i>I think&nbsp;<strong>climate change is a closer problem</strong>. AI being that powerful is a ways off</i>\u201d</li><li><strong>\u201c</strong><i><strong>Nuclear wars are much more severe&nbsp;at this moment.</strong></i><strong>\u201d</strong></li><li><strong>\u201c</strong><i><strong>I don't see AI as imminent of a threat as pandemic, nuclear war, and climate change</strong></i><strong>.\u201d</strong></li><li>\u201c<i>I think there are&nbsp;<strong>much more pressing issues</strong> than AI</i>\u201d</li><li>\u201c<i>disagree because there are more pressing issues in society then AI and while it can be an issue we haven't gotten to that point yet.</i>\u201d</li><li>\u201c<i>I think that those other risks (war, famine) are&nbsp;<strong>more urgent and pressing</strong> than the risks posed by current AI technologies.</i>\u201d</li><li>\u201c<i>this is most definitely not an immediate/urgent issue; the state of our air quality and earth literally being on fire is much more important</i>\u201d</li></ul><p>This also potentially has implications for communicating AI:</p><ul><li>The&nbsp;<i>urgency</i> of AI may be important to emphasize or to make more argument for. This need not require arguing for short timelines, but might involve making the case that preparations need to be made well in advance (or explaining why the problem cannot simply be solved at a later time).</li></ul><h2>Not extinction</h2><p>A large number of comments invoked the theme that AI would not cause extinction. In itself this may not seem very informative. However, this may still raise questions for how best to communicate AI risk. It is unclear how well communication about AI risk which specifically refers to the risk of \u201cextinction\u201d compares in its effect to communication which refers more generally to (severe) harms from AI. If people find the threat of&nbsp;<i>extinction</i> specifically implausible, then this referring to this may be less persuasive than other messaging. It is possible that there may be a tradeoff with communications which invoke more severe outcomes at the cost of lower general plausibility. Moreover, this tradeoff may imply different approaches when speaking to people who are the most inclined towards scepticism of extreme AI risks vs others.</p><p>A number of comments noted that they did not think AI would cause extinction, but did think there were grounds to be concerned about other risks:</p><ul><li>\u201c<i>I dont believe AI poses an extinction risk although I do think it should be carefully used and monitored to ensure it does not have bad effects</i>\u201d</li><li>\u201c<i>The risk of extinction from A.I. is overblown. We are in much more danger from governments around the world using the tech on their own people not some rouge A.I.</i>\u201d</li><li>\u201c<i>I agree that AI is an issue, but it is an issue because it is a tool that can be used for harm, not a tool that is used for physical harm or extinction.</i>\u201d</li></ul><p>\u2018Not extinction\u2019 codes were also often combined with other themes which offered more explanation e.g. \u2018Not yet\u2019 (1.5%), \u2018Not capable\u2019 (1.5%), \u2018Control\u2019 and \u2018Scifi\u2019.</p><h2>Not yet</h2><p>The theme that AI was \u2018Not yet\u2019 a threat was also commonly mentioned, occurring in 21.6% of comments.</p><ul><li>\u201c<i>It is unlikely to happen anytime soon.</i>\u201d</li><li>\u201c<i>I think that it's possible that very far ahead in the future it could become dangerous but right now, saying it should be focused on as much as nuclear war is an exaggeration</i>\u201d</li><li>\u201c<i>There is no imminent threat of mass extinction due to AI.</i>\u201d</li><li>\u201c<i>I don't think it is the big issue that many do because I remember writing a research paper about AI in 1984 about how dangerous it was and how it would destroy humanity and here we are 39 years later.</i>\u201d</li><li>\u201c<i>I don't believe the level of AI we currently have is that dangerous\u2026</i>\u201d</li><li>\u201c<i>I don't believe AI will pose an extinction level threat within the next century.</i>\u201d</li><li>\u201c<i>I don't think AI is anywhere near that level of concern yet. Maybe in a few years, but currently it's just taking information and rewriting it.</i>\u201d</li><li>\u201c<i>AI is simply not advanced enough yet that we need to be concerned about this. Though it is not without potential harms (see the controversy surrounding the Replika \"companion AI\" for examples), it is not intelligent enough to actually make its own decisions.</i>\u201d</li><li>\u201c<i>Any such risk is years, decades, if not a century off. It's not nearly as important an issue as any other for now.</i>\u201d</li><li>\u201c<i>I don't think it's a large threat at this point in time, though AI ethics is definitely undervalued</i>\u201d</li><li>\u201c<i>I can\u2019t even get Siri to reliable dictate my text messages so it feels like we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not close to this</i>\u201d</li><li>\u201c<i>Right now we are at the dawn of the age of AI. AI doesn't have the ability to make large-scale decisions which could result in extinciton on its own. And due to hallucinations and it probably won't ever be in a position to directly cause an extinction.</i>\u201d</li><li>\u201c<i>I don't think AI is either capable nor able enough to do something like this in its current form. AI development should be monitored and used for the greater good, but it is not a high risk for the human race as of right now.</i>\u201d</li></ul><p>One thing that may be striking and surprising to readers concerned about AI safety is that many respondents seem to treat the fact that AI is (ex hypothesi) not&nbsp;<i>currently</i> capable of causing extinction as straightforwardly implying (without the need for additional explanation) that we don\u2019t need to be concerned about it now. Of course, it is possible that many of these respondents simply endorse many additional unstated premises (e.g. and it won\u2019t soon become capable; and we would be able to respond quickly to prevent or solve the problem in time etc.) which do imply that we don\u2019t need to currently make it a global priority. Nevertheless, there may be value in better understanding people\u2019s reasoning here and what the common cruxes are for their views.</p><h2>Control</h2><p>A sizable minority of respondents mentioned the idea that AI would be under our control in their response. Many of these referred to the idea that an AI would necessarily (as an AI) be under our control, while a smaller number invoked the idea that we could and would regulate it.</p><ul><li>\u201cAI will always rely on humans.\u201d</li><li>\u201cAI is an help created and programmed by humans, it has no conscience and I don't believe in these catastrophic fairy tales without scientific basis\u201d</li><li>\u201cRisk of extinction? To me, that is really far-fetched, AI is still a programmable machine, not capable of taking over the world.\u201d</li><li>\u201cAI is a man made creation which should be easy to program to act in responsible ways.\u201d</li><li>\u201cI disagree because humans will always have the ability to program AI.\u201d</li><li>\u201cI somewhat disagree because as long as AI is being regulated than it does not need to be extinct\u201d</li><li>\u201cI think as long as AI is handled correctly from the get-go, it will not become a larger issue.\u201d</li><li>\u201cI think AI take-over scenarios are massively exaggerated. Not only am I convinced that AI is extremely unlikely to try and \"take over the world\" because AI is only capable of doing that if AI is given a physical presence. Also, companies who create AI clearly can control exactly what it does because most AI projects have been able to filter out AI responses that contain illegal or sexual content.\u201d</li><li>I would disagree because Al is programed by people. It will only do as programed.</li><li>I don't agree that much but I admit I don't fully understand AI. I disagree because with the level of understanding I have I don't get why the computer running the supposed dangerous AI cannot just be shut off.</li></ul><p>Many of these statement may seem to be based on factual confusions or misunderstandings about AI e.g. that an AI would inherently be under human control because it can\u2019t do anything it\u2019s not programmed to do or can\u2019t do anything without being told to by a human, or because AIs are already completely controlled (because they filter out illegal or sexual content). Future research could explore to what extent overcoming these misperceptions is tractable and to what extent debunking such misperceptions reduces people\u2019s opposition, or whether these views are more deep-seated (for example, due to more fundamental cognitive biases in thinking about AI as agents).&nbsp;</p><h2>Benefits</h2><p>A similar number of respondents mentioned \u2018Benefits\u2019 as mentioned \u2018Control.\u2019</p><ul><li>\u201cI disagree because I think we need to embrace AI. I do believe that it has damaging power so it does need to be controlled, like nuclear weapons but ultimately I see AI as something that can improve our daily lives if we control, use and implement it correctly. Now I do agree that we don't have a good track record of this. Social Media can be used for something positive but because the tech giants do not hold accountability for their own creations, Social Media has run amuck because it was left in the hands of humans. Because of this I certainly see the concerns of those opposing AI. If we learn from our past mistakes I think we can control and use AI for it's positives\u201d</li><li>\u201cBecause of its capacity to automate processes, better decision-making, personalize experiences, improve safety, advance healthcare, enable communication, spur innovation, and support economic growth, artificial intelligence (AI) is crucial. To guarantee responsible execution and reduce possible difficulties, ethical issues must be addressed.\u201d</li><li>\u201cI only somewhat disagree because I think AI can be used for good and right now, we're in the creative phase of AI and I think although we may need some kind of rules, it shouldn't be overly strict.\u201d</li><li>\u201cI somewhat disagreed because at this current time, AI seems much more beneficial than it is harmful. If it becomes more harmful in the future, that answer would likely change.\u201d</li><li>\u201cI don't like the fearful/pessimistic approach. I think AI technology should be embraced.\u201d</li><li>\u201cWe focus too much on the doom and gloom of AI and not the advantages of AI. It is inevitable whatever AI becomes.\u201d</li><li>\u201cI can see why it might be label as a threat because of how scary advance AI can become , but I also see the many potential good it can create in the technology world. So I kind of somewhat disagree to have it label a global priority.\u201d</li></ul><p>Why believing that AI could have benefits would be a reason to disagree with the statement may be unclear and, in fact, the reasons for referring to the benefits of AI as reasons to disagree with the statement were heterogeneous.&nbsp;</p><p>Some acknowledge that AI is a threat and needs control, but are still optimistic about it bringing benefits (\u201c<i>I do believe that it has damaging power so it does need to be controlled, like nuclear weapons but ultimately I see AI as something that can improve our daily lives if we control, use and implement it correctly</i>.\u201d Others simply deny that AI poses a threat of extinction and/or think that AI can increase our chances of survival \u201c<i>We are not at risk of extinction from AI. We may be able to use AI to our advantage to increease our survivability\u2026</i>\u201d Others seemed to object more to pessimism about AI in general (\u201c<i>I don't like the fearful/pessimistic approach. I think AI technology should be embraced</i>\u201d or to think simply that the benefits would likely outweigh the harms (\u201c<i>I somewhat disagreed because at this current time, AI seems much more beneficial than it is harmful. If it becomes more harmful in the future, that answer would likely change</i>.\u201d)</p><p>This theme was relatively infrequently mentioned. Nevertheless, it is important to note that in one of our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/ConFiY9cRmg37fs2p/us-public-opinion-of-ai-policy-and-risk#Good_vs__Harm_from_AI\"><u>prior surveys</u></a>, just under half (48%) of respondents leaned in the direction of thinking that AI would do more good than harm (compared to 31% believing it would do more harm than good). Responses about whether AI would cause more good than harm were also&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/ConFiY9cRmg37fs2p/us-public-opinion-of-ai-policy-and-risk#Associations_among_AI_attitudes\"><u>associated with support for a pause on AI research and for regulating AI</u></a>.</p><h2>Not capable / Not physical&nbsp;</h2><p>Responses in the \u2018Not capable\u2019 category tended to invoke the idea that AI was not intelligent, sentient or autonomous enough to cause harm:</p><ul><li>\u201cI disagree because there is no way a computer is intelligent enough or even close to becoming sentient. It is not on the level of war which can wipe us out in an instant\u201d</li><li>\u201cI don't think AI is that big of a problem because I don't think that AI can have consciousness.\u201d</li><li>\u201cAI is nowhere near powerful enough to be free-thinking enough to be dangerous. The only necessary blocks are to create tags for humans using it fraudulently.\u201d</li><li>\u201cIt seems unlikely for AI to have a reason to take over because they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t experience actual emotion.\u201d</li><li>\u201cAI is currently at an infant level of understanding with no concept of human emotions. Will it can react to basic human emotions it cannot understand them. AI is like a tool that can speed up information gathering and prcessing it does not really understand what the information is. For example, it can tell if the sun is shining or not but cannot tell or feel the warmth of the sunlight on your face.\u201d</li></ul><p>In addition, two responses mentioned that AI was not physical specifically, which we coded separately:</p><ul><li>\u201cI think AI take-over scenarios are massively exaggerated. Not only am I convinced that AI is extremely unlikely to try and \"take over the world\" because AI is only capable of doing that if AI is given a physical presence\u2026\u201d</li><li>\u201c\u2026I also don't understand why AI would want us to be extinct, or how it could possibly achieve it without a physical body.\u201d</li></ul><p>Many of these objections also seem to be points which are often addressed by advocates for AI safety. Public support for AI safety might benefit from these arguments being disseminated more widely. Further research might explore to what extent the general public have encountered or considered these arguments (e.g. that an AI would not need a physical body to cause harm), and whether encountering being presented with these arguments influences their beliefs.</p><h2>Sci fi</h2><p>Only a relatively small number of comments mentioned the \u2018Scifi\u2019 theme. These typically either dismissed AI concerns as \u201cscifi\u201d, or speculated that scifi was the cause of why people were concerned about it:</p><ul><li>I think these people watch a little too many sci fi movies</li><li>It seems a bit overdramatic, just because that is a popular topic in fiction does not mean it's likely to be reality.</li><li>I think people have this uninformed view that AI is dangerous because of movies and shows, but this really is not something to be concerned about.</li><li>I just don't think that it's like in the movies to where the a.i will take over and cause us to go extinct. I feel like it, or they are computers and work off programs but yeah I guess they are taught to learn and do things constantly growing in knowledge but I just don't see it ever learning to take over humanity and causing such a catastrophe.</li></ul><h2>Responses from those who did not disagree</h2><p>We did not formally code comments from respondents who did not disagree with the statement. Comments from those who agreed generally appeared less informative, since many simply reiterated agreement that AI was a risk (\u201cIt has a lot of risk potential, so it should be taken seriously\u201d). Likewise, responses from those who neither agreed nor disagreed or selected \u2018Don\u2019t know\u2019 typically expressed uncertainty or ambivalence (\u201cI'm not knowledgeable on the topic\u201d).</p><p>That said, these responses are still potentially somewhat informative, so we may conduct further analysis of them at a later date.</p><h1>Demographic differences</h1><p>We also explored whether there were any associations between different demographic groupings and particular types of responses. Although we mostly found few differences (though note that the small sample size of disagreeing responses would limit our ability to detect even fairly large differences), we found very large differences between the proportion of younger-than-median and older-than-median responses coded as mentioning \u2018Other priorities.\u2019 Specifically, younger respondents were dramatically more likely to be coded as referring to Other priorities (43.3%) than older respondents (27.8%).<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefz9keo5kbmgn\"><sup><a href=\"#fnz9keo5kbmgn\">[6]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;This makes sense (post hoc), given that many of these responses referred to climate change or to other socially progressive coded causes. However, since these were exploratory analyses they should be confirmed in additional studies with larger sample sizes.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefistf1i3775\"><sup><a href=\"#fnistf1i3775\">[7]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;</p><p>This finding seems potentially relevant as it may suggest a factor which might attenuate support for AI risk reduction among the young, even if we might generally have expected support to be higher in this population.</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/RYNtykh5xM467zRNj/rafhhyzsih0gffxdljym\"></p><h1>Limitations and future research</h1><p>While we think that this data potentially offers a variety of useful insights, there are important limitations. A major consideration is that individuals\u2019 explicit statements of their reasons for their beliefs and attitudes may simply reflect&nbsp;<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19852252/\"><i><u>post hoc</u></i></a> rationalizations or ways of making sense of their beliefs and attitudes, as respondents may be&nbsp;<a href=\"https://home.csulb.edu/~cwallis/382/readings/482/nisbett%20saying%20more.pdf\"><u>unaware</u></a> of the true reasons for their responses. If so, this may limit some of the conclusions suggested by these findings. For example, respondents may claim that they object to the statement about AI for particular reasons, even though their response is motivated by other factors. Alternatively, individuals\u2019 judgements may be over-determined such that, even if the particular objections they mention in their comment were overcome, they would continue to object. And more broadly, as we noted, responses to the CAIS statement may differ from responses to specific AI policies or to AI safety more broadly. For example, people may support or object to parts of the CAIS statement specifically, or they might support particular policies, such as regulation, despite general skepticism or aversion to AI safety writ large.&nbsp;</p><p>Given these limitations, further research seems valuable. We have highlighted a number of specific areas for future research in the above report. However, some general priorities we would highlight would be:</p><ul><li>More in-depth qualitative research (via interviews or focus groups)<ul><li>The qualitative data we have gathered here was relatively brief and so only offered relatively shallow insights into respondents\u2019 views. Using different methodologies we could get a richer sense of the different reasons why individuals might support or oppose AI safety proposals and explore these in more detail. For example, through being able to ask followup questions, we would be able to clarify individual views and how they would respond to different questions.</li></ul></li><li>Larger scale quantitative surveys to confirm the prevalence of these objections<ul><li>As these qualitative results were based on a small sample size and were not weighted to be representative of the US population, larger representative surveys could give a more accurate estimate of the prevalence of endorsement of these objections in the general population.</li><li>This could also be used to assess more precisely how these objections vary across different groups and how far different objections are associated with attitudes towards AI safety.</li></ul></li><li>Experimental message testing research<ul><li>Message testing research could test some of the hypotheses suggested here experimentally. For example, we could examine whether communications which refer to extinction or to other priorities alongside AI risk perform better or worse than messages which do not do this. Or we could test whether arguments tackling the idea that other priorities mean we should not prioritise AI risk perform better than other messages.</li><li>This could also assess whether different groups respond better or worse to different messages.</li></ul></li><li>Testing the effect of tackling misconceptions<ul><li>Surveys could empirically assess both the extent to which the wider population endorse different beliefs (or misconceptions) about AI risk (e.g. that AIs could not do anything without a human telling them to), as well as test the effect of presenting contrary information responding to these misconceptions.</li></ul></li></ul><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/HfnebqujtDxtppyN5/rbpobtm5kq22rsautgkp\"></p><p><i>This research is a project of</i><a href=\"http://rethinkpriorities.org/\"><i> <u>Rethink Priorities</u></i></a><i>.</i> <i>This post was written by David Moss.

For example, \u201cViolence is never moral\u201d and \u201cCulture determines morality\u201d contradict because of the possibility of violent cultures.</li>\n<li>Sometimes our stated justifications for our moral intuitions are contradictory, but those intuitions could be represented with a non-contradictory moral rule.</li>\n<li>Often, our intuitive ranking will be incomplete, which makes moral decisions difficult even if we could perfectly predict the consequences.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Finding a moral rule helps us to correct poor moral intuitions, explain our good moral intuitions with more clarity, and guide us where our intuitions don\u2019t exist.</p>\n<p>Our view of thinking of moral rules as summarising moral preferences over timelines works not just for consequentialist theories, but for all moral theories that meet some fairly general criteria (namely, completeness and transitivity).</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/JYehHdj45ALZDpdSh/yfril0eg6vbutpc9yvjo\" alt=\"Here\u2019s to feeling good all the time\"><br>\n<em>Even the really dumb ones</em></p>\n<h1>How are we going to link this to goals?</h1>\n<p>Now this part is extremely important. If we\u2019re clever about how we represent each timeline, and how we represent each goal, we can mathematically connect goals to morality. The most elegant representation, if I do say so myself, is the following.</p>\n<p>Let each timeline be the set containing all statements that are empirically true <em>at all times and places</em> within that timeline. For example, \u201c[Unique identifier for you] is reading [unique identifier for this sentence]\u201d would <em>not</em> be in the representation of the timeline that we exist in, because once you begin the next sentence, it\u2019s no longer true. Instead, the statement would have to say something like \u201c[Unique identifier for you] read [unique identifier for that sentence] during [the time period at which you read that sentence]\u201d. For brevity\u2019s sake, the remaining example statements won\u2019t contain unique identifiers or time periods, as the precise meaning of the statements should be clear from the context.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/JYehHdj45ALZDpdSh/qawnqrg8nn4pcgh55bvu\" alt=\"The Hulk solves time travel\"><br>\n<em>What? I see this wordy explanation as an absolute win.</em></p>\n<p>Now if you\u2019re a stickler, <em>and I know some of you are</em> (yes, I\u2019m pointing at <em>you</em>), you\u2019re probably thinking \u201cBut we can\u2019t actually talk about timelines, because at best, we only make educated guesses about the future.\u201d So let\u2019s incorporate uncertainty by using \u201ctimeline forecasts\u201d.</p>\n<p>Let\u2019s represent these forecasts as the set of all predictions that we would make about a particular timeline <em>right now</em>. For example, the pull-the-lever forecast contains the statement \u201cThe five live with a credence of 1\u201d. Note that each forecast can roughly be thought of as a probability distribution of timelines.</p>\n<p>(Why are they effectively probability distributions? Each timeline contains <em>all</em> statements that are true about itself. So if \u201cYou pull the lever\u201d, \u201cThe five live\u201d, and \u201cThe one dies\u201d are within a timeline, you can string these into a single, larger statement that is also in that timeline: \u201cYou pull the lever, <em>and</em> the five live, <em>and</em> the one dies\u201d. So, each timeline contains a very large statement that uniquely identifies it within any finite set of timelines. And that combined statement, amended with an associated credence, will be within our timeline forecast.)</p>\n<p>So, why is this particular representation so useful?</p>\n<h1>Linking the pieces together</h1>\n<p>This representation allows us to link moral rules to forecasts to \u201cgoalsets\u201d.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/JYehHdj45ALZDpdSh/bqrqupnrypoid8soydbp\" alt=\"Charlie as a crazy detective\"><br>\n<em>Pictured: Me explaining literally anything</em></p>\n<p>We\u2019ll say that a moral rule chooses the best forecasts. I.e. it\u2019s a function such that</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the input is any set of forecasts, and</li>\n<li>the output is the set of all forecasts that are weakly preferred to anything in the input set.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As for goalsets, they can be \u201csatisfied\u201d by particular forecasts (i.e. your goalset is a subset of that forecast). For example, let\u2019s say your goalset in the trolley problem contains only one statement: \u201cThere was no way to save more people, with a credence of 1\u201d. Then only the pull-the-lever forecast satisfies your goalset.</p>\n<p>The last piece of this is your \u201cempirical model\u201d, which tells you what your forecast would be if you attempted a given \u201cplan\u201d. (I.e. it\u2019s a function that maps a plan to a forecast.)</p>\n<h1>Wait, why goalsets? Can\u2019t we evaluate goals individually?</h1>\n<p>We cannot evaluate goals individually. There are two reasons for this. (1) Any issue with a goal will manifest in a goalset that contains it, so we can rephrase any criticisms of a goal in terms of goalsets. And (2) there are times when we have to look at the goalset <em>as a whole</em> before identifying an issue.</p>\n<p>For example, suppose we\u2019re stranded on an island. Suppose the best outcome occurs when one of us hunts for food and the other builds a shelter or vice versa. So \u201cI build a shelter\u201d is a goal that fits in one ideal outcome, and \u201cYou build a shelter\u201d fits in another. However, if our goalsets contains both those statements, we\u2019ll starve (albeit in the comfort of an excellent shelter).</p>\n<p>Okay? Good. Now we have everything in place.</p>\n<h1>What\u2019s in the next part?</h1>\n<p>Remember that, at the start of all this, our main purpose is to show that mechanism design is the right way to make policy. Hopefully the constraints we outline will also be practical takeaways for you, just as they\u2019ve been for me.</p>\n<p>We\u2019ll show that we can make perfect policy with mechanism design (which we\u2019ll rigorously define), as well as use it to navigate towards perfect policy when we don\u2019t have all the answers just yet.</p>\n<p>We now have all the tools to objectively define criteria for all of this, and we can prove mathematically how these properties relate to each other. Which, in my opinion, is pretty damn cool. If it interests you too, see you in the next one.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>This is Part 2 of a series. I\u2019ll try to write a new post each week.

Well, since you\u2019re benevolent, it follows that the policies must be measured against some kind of moral criteria\u2026</p>\n<h1>Bentham called. He\u2019s bringing over the utili-tea.</h1>\n<p>Maybe we select the transport policy that results in the \u201cbetter world\u201d, that makes sense, right?</p>\n<p>Wait, what if the two transport policies are identical, except one version extends one train with an extra railcar, within which cancer researchers produce a cure. On the one hand, the cancer-research version produces a better outcome than the plain-train version. But on the other hand, it is <em>clearly</em> stepping outside its purview as a transport system.</p>\n<p>So choosing a policy solely because it results in the \u201cbetter\u201d outcome categorically does not make sense: Each policy must have a bounded domain.</p>\n<h1>Just use science, you fools.</h1>\n<p>What about if we approach the policy-choice problem scientifically?</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/NbK7ENNDRxefcZttt/oscronw2kisle9ceau0p\" alt=\"Scientism\"><br>\n<em>New studies suggest that I\u2019m right, and you\u2019re wrong, so shut up</em></p>\n<p>Aha! Let\u2019s run a randomized experiment, we\u2019ll test one transport system in half the world\u2019s countries, and another transport system in the other half, and see which countries do better against some metric! Again, we reach the \u201cbounded domains\u201d problem, but if our metric is itself bounded to the domain of interest, we might avoid that problem.</p>\n<p>The main issue here is the cost considerations: Even if the experiments had no financial cost, we still have the opportunity cost of running the wrong policy. And because of this, we must figure out how to choose which policies to test in the first place, which cannot be solved through empiricism: It\u2019s obviously nonsensical to think, \u201cBefore I perform any experiment, I should perform an experiment\u201d.</p>\n<p>I\u2019m not saying that empiricism has no place in public policy. It does. You need science to estimate parameters and to test assumptions. But there is no way around it: We need a theory first so that we know which parameters to estimate, and which assumptions to test. Even empiricism is based on a solid theoretical foundation. (In the case of deterministic models with infallible experiments, falsification only works because of <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modus_tollens\">modus tollens</a>. In the more general case, its foundation is Bayesian.) Empiricism could not be relied upon without theory.</p>\n<p>I\u2019ve encountered many who claim that \u201ctheory cannot count as evidence\u201d. That statement is effectively a claim that either logic does not work or that there is little value in containing our uncertainty to a small set of testable (or otherwise reasonable) assumptions. Both claims are, I hope, obviously ridiculous to you, dear reader. (See: all of mathematics and much of physics.)</p>\n<h1>Policymakers might know some things\u2026</h1>\n<p>Maybe we can gain some wisdom by looking at how policy is currently done.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/NbK7ENNDRxefcZttt/qorpbnvmngos8t1fjaq1\" alt=\"Dumpster fire\"><br>\n<em>Pictured: How policy is currently done</em></p>\n<p>In my experience, the approach of most policymakers is to see a problem produced under the current system, and then attempt some alteration to fix that problem.</p>\n<p>For example, when I worked in the Farm Household Allowance team, the allowance had a limited number of days that recipients were allowed to be paid, as well as a \u201cgradient payment\u201d (if you earn a little more private income, you get paid a little less welfare).</p>\n<p>This meant that farmers who were eligible for, say, half the maximum rate of pay faced a dilemma: Get paid half the max rate now, or avoid claiming an allowance <em>that you are eligible for</em>, because you might be under even more financial distress in the future (and thus receive a greater payment at that time). Burdening those people with that kind of choice is a big problem. So, we changed to an \u201call-or-nothing\u201d payment: You\u2019re either at the max rate or you get nothing. Problem solved!</p>\n<p>And this illustrates the failure of focusing on \u201cthe current problem\u201d\u2014you create new ones. In our case, if someone is $1 below the income threshold, they get the maximum payment, which is several hundred dollars; if they earn $2 more, they lose all of it. This is a strong disincentive to earn more money when you\u2019re right below the threshold. That\u2019s bad. Customers should never be worse off from earning more private income.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, we can solve both issues: I proposed we have a gradient payment and if someone is paid at, say, 17 percent of the max rate, they lose 0.17 days of entitlement (rather than a full day). This arguably met the legislative requirements (the legislators neglected to define the word \u201cday\u201d, the fools). So I encoded the desired properties mathematically and showed, under a reasonable set of assumptions, that my proposal guaranteed both of the desired criteria. We did not proceed with my idea (see above image).</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/NbK7ENNDRxefcZttt/gyx3poy7xngdo9gdqya9\" alt=\"It ain\u2019t much, but it\u2019s honest work\"><br>\n<em>My team after coming up with one idea and calling it a day</em></p>\n<h1>Okay, fine. This problem is harder than I thought. What do we do?</h1>\n<p>So, you can\u2019t use simple utility maximization\u2026 And you can\u2019t really do experimental policy design\u2026 And you can\u2019t focus on \u201cfixing the current problems\u201d.</p>\n<p>Then what can you do?</p>\n<p>I suspect that mechanism designers have it right: define an ideal set of goals (don\u2019t worry, we\u2019ll define exactly what that means later), and then prove, under a reasonable set of assumptions, that the proposed policy satisfies those goals.</p>\n<p>To prove they\u2019re right, what we need is a theory that shows mechanism design works according to some reasonable (and, ideally, unobjectionable) justification, i.e. in the same way that modus tollens is a reasonable justification for experimental falsification. And that\u2019s exactly what I aim to do here. So if that interests you, please keep on reading. And if it doesn\u2019t\u2014but you make government policy\u2014read it anyway.</p>\n<p>What I hope you\u2019ll come away with is a set of non-obvious and necessary constraints for thinking about making choices (policy or otherwise), just as modus tollens constrains you from believing in a theory that has been falsified. I warn you that this is a lot more complicated than justifications behind falsification.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>This is Part 1 of a series. <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/JYehHdj45ALZDpdSh/the-benevolent-ruler-s-handbook-part-2-morality-rules\">Here's Part 2</a>.</p>\n<p>I'll try to write a new post each week.
