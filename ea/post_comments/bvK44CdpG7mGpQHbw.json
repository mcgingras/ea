Secondly, as a consequence of that, naming a prize after someone gives an impression that the prize is approved by someone connected to the named person, otherwise it is a bit misleading.

There seems to be no estate which even could give permission to use the name. I don't think anyone has the impression that Truman's family or estate authorized this, and as above, from my research, they couldn't now have done so, as there is no-one authorized to do it.
