When I encountered the concept in formal epistemology I remember \"deference to someone on claim X\" literally meaning (a) that you adopt that persons probability judgement on X. Within EA and your post (?) the concept often doesn't seem to be used in this way. Instead, I guess people think of deference as something like (b) \"updating in the direction of a persons probability judgement on X\" or (c)\"taking that person's probability estimate as significant evidence for (against) X if that person leans towards X (not-X)\"?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>I think (a) - (c) are importantly different. For instance, adopting someones credence doesn't always mean that you are taking their opinion as evidence for the claim in question even if they lean towards it being true: you might adopt someones high credence in X and thereby lowering your credence (because yours was even higher before). In that case, you update as though their high credence was evidence <em>against</em> X.\nYou might also update in the direction of someones credence without taking on their credence. Lastly, you might lower your credence in X by updating in someones direction even if they lean towards X.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Bottom line: these three concepts don't refer to the same \"epistemic process\" so I think its good to make clear what we mean by deference.</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>Here is how I would draw the conceptual distinctions:</li>\n</ol>\n<p>(I) deference to someones credence in X = you adopt their probability in X\n(II) positively updating on someone's view = increasing your confidence in X upon hearing their probability on X\n(III) negatively updating on someones view = decreasing your confidence in X upon hearing their probability in X</p>\n<p>I hope this comment was legible, please ask for clarification if anything was unclearly expressed :)</p>\n", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "Aaron__Maiwald"}}, {"_id": "oSybF5o64oT7p5Pdz", "postedAt": "2022-10-10T17:19:58.030Z", "postId": "FtggfJ2oxNSN8Niix", "htmlBody": "<p>Thanks for your comment!</p><blockquote><p>Asking \"who do you defer to?\" feels like a simplification</p></blockquote><p>Agreed!

I understand why some might people might perceive online conversations that take longer and where nuance can get lost to be too tedious and take too much time for the value they provide. Yet why I ask is because I know I could dive deep into Metaculus forecasts or how many dozens of posts but I don't know where to start and I don't want to waste time.
