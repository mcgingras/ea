Obviously you want to make milk, cheddar, bleu, and casu marzu customers feel like welcome members of the dairy empire. Given that the potential market size substantially diminishes as you step up the weird-dairy latter, and the cost of customer acquisition increases, how much of your marketing resources will be spent on promoting each type of dairy?</p>\n<p>My guess is that the EA ecosystem under-emphasizes acquiring new cheddar consumers, but I could easily be wrong.
