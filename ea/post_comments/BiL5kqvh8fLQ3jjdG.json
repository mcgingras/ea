The intuitive episode is a natural unit of training (e.g. a game), while the incentivized episode is the period of time over which training directly pressures the model to optimize.</p><p><strong>Key points</strong>:</p><ol><li>The incentivized episode is the period over which training actively punishes the model for not optimizing. It may be shorter than the full training period.</li><li>The intuitive episode is a natural unit picked for training (e.g. a game). It is not necessarily the same as the incentivized episode.</li><li>Care is needed in assessing if the intuitive episode matches the incentivized episode, i.e. if training incentivizes cross-episode optimization.</li><li>Some training methods directly pressure cross-episode optimization, others don't. Details of training algorithms matter.</li><li>Conflating the two concepts can lead to inappropriate assumptions about incentivized time horizons. Empirical testing is important.</li></ol><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i>This comment was auto-generated by the EA Forum Team.
