Here are some quick questions and points of skepticism.</p><p>Starting from the top, you say:</p><blockquote><p>We estimate optimistically that there is a 60% chance that all the fundamental algorithmic improvements needed for AGI will be developed on a suitable timeline.</p></blockquote><p>This section appears to be an estimate of all-things-considered feasibility of transformative AI, and draws extensively on evidence about how lots of things go wrong in practice when implementing complicated projects. But then in subsequent sections you talk about how even if we \"succeed\" at this step there is still a significant probability of failing because the algorithms don't work in a realistic amount of time.</p><p>Can you say what exactly you are assigning a 60% probability to, and why it's getting multiplied with ten other factors? Are you saying that there is a 40% chance that by 2043 AI algorithms couldn't yield AGI no matter how much serial time and compute they had available? (It seems surprising to claim that even by 2023!) Presumably not that, but what exactly are you giving a 60% chance?</p><p>(ETA: after reading later sections more carefully I think you might be saying 60% chance that our software is about as good as nature's, and maybe implicitly assuming there is a ~0% chance of being significantly better than that or building TAI without that? I'm not sure if that's right though, if so it's a huge point of methodological disagreement. I'll return to this point later.)</p><p>In section 2 you say:</p><blockquote><p>Transformative AGI by 2043 depends critically on the development of non-sequential reinforcement learning training methods with no real human analogue.</p></blockquote><p>And give this a 40% probability. I don't think I understand this claim or its justification. (This is related to my uncertainty about what your \"60%\" in the last section was referring to.)</p><p>It seems to me that if you had human-like learning you would be able to produce transformative AGI by 2043:</p><ol><li>In fact it looks like human-like learning would enable AI to learn human-level physical skills:<ol><li>10 years is sufficient for humans to learn most physical skills from scratch, and you are talking about 20 year timelines. So why is the serial time for learning even a candidate blocker?</li><li>Humans learn new physical skills (including e.g. operating unfamiliar machinery) within <strong>tens of hours</strong>. This requires transfer from other things humans have learned, but those tasks are not always closely related (e.g. I learn to drive a car based on experience walking) and AI systems will have access to transfer from tasks that seem if anything more similar (e.g. prediction of the relevant physical environments, predictions of expert behavior in similar domains, closed-loop behavior in a wide range of simulated environments, closed-loop behavior on physical tasks with shorter timescales, behavior in virtual environments...).</li><li>We can easily run tens of thousands of copies of AI systems in parallel. Existing RL is massively parallelizable. Human evolution gives no evidence about the difficulty of parallelizing learning in this way. Based on observations of human learning it seems extremely likely to me that parallelization 10,000 fold can reduce serial time by at least 10x (which is all that is needed). Extrapolations of existing RL algorithms seem to suggest serial requirements more like 10,000 episodes, with almost all of the compute used to run a massive number of episodes in parallel, which would be 1 year even for a 1-hour task. It seems hard to construct physical tasks that don't provide rich feedback after even shorter horizons than 1 hour (and therefore suitable for a gradient descent step given enough parallel samples) so this seems pretty conservative.</li></ol></li><li>Regardless of learning physical tasks, humans are able to learn to do R&amp;D after 20 years of experience. AI systems operate at 10x speed and most environments relevant to hardware and software R&amp;D can be sped up by at least 10x. So it seems like AI systems could be human-level at a wide range of tasks, sufficient to accelerate further AI progress, even if they just used non-parallelized human learning over 2 years. If you really thought physical tasks were somehow impossibly difficult (which I don't think is justified) then this becomes the dominant path to AGI. This is particularly important because multiple of your later points also seem to rest on the distinctive difficulty of automating physical tasks, which should just shift your probability further and further to an explosion of automated R&amp;D which drives automation of physical labor.</li></ol><p>I think you are disagreeing with these claims, but I'm not sure about that. For example, you mention parallelizable learning but seem to give it &lt;10% probability despite the fact that it is the overwhelmingly dominant paradigm in current practice and you don't say anything about why it might not work.</p><p>(This isn't super relevant to my mainline view, since in fact I think AI is <i>much</i> worse at learning quickly than humans and will likely be transformative way before reaching parity. This is related to the general point about being unnecessarily conjunctive, but here I'm just trying to understand and express disagreement with the particular path you lay out and the probabilities you assign.)</p><p>In section 3 you say:</p><blockquote><p>Software and hardware efficiencies combine to surpass current computation cost efficiency, and/or the efficiency of the human brain, by at least five orders of magnitude.</p></blockquote><p>I think you claim that each synapse firing event requires about 1-10 million floating point operations (with some error bars), and that there is only a 16% chance that computers will be able to do enough compute for $25/hour.</p><p>This is probably the part of the report I am most skeptical of:</p><ul><li>How do you square this with our experience in AI so far? Overall you seem to think it is possible that AI will be as effective as brains but unlikely to be much better. But if a biological neuron is probably ten million times more efficient than an artificial neuron, then aren't we already much better than biology in tons of domains? Is there <strong>any</strong> task for which performance can be quantified and where you think this estimate provides a sane guideline to the inference-time compute required to solve the task? Shouldn't you be putting <i>significant</i> probability on our algorithms being radically better than biology in many important ways?&nbsp;<ul><li>Replicating the human visual cortex should take millions of times more compute than we have ever used, yet we can match human performance on a range of quantifiable perceptual tasks and are making rapid progress, and I'm actually not aware of tasks where it's even plausible that we are 6 orders of magnitude away.</li><li>Learned policies for robotic control using only hundreds of thousands of neurons already seem to reach comparable competence to insects, but you should expect it to be significantly worse than a nematode. Aren't you surprised to observe successful grasping and walking?</li><li>Traditional control systems like those used by Boston Dynamics seem to produce more competent motor control than small animals despite using amounts of compute close to 1 flop per synapse. You focus on ML, but I don't know why---isn't classical control a more reasonable point of comparison to small animals that have algorithms designed directly by evolution rather than learned in a lifetime, and doesn't your argument very strongly predict that it should be impossible?</li><li>Qualitatively it's hard to compare GPT-3 to humans, but just to be clear you are saying that it should behave like a brain with ~1000 neurons. This is at least surprising (e.g. I think would have led to big misses if it had been used to make any qualitative predictions), and to me casts doubt on a story where you can't get transformative AI using less than the analog of a hundred billion neurons.</li></ul></li><li>Your biological analysis seems to hinge on the assertion that precise simulation of neurons is necessary to get similar levels of computational utility (and even from there the analysis is pretty conservative, e.g. by assuming that performing that you need to perform a very expensive computation thousands of times a second). I don't personally consider this plausible and I think the main argument given for it is that \"if not, why would we have all these proteins?\" which I don't find persuasive (since synapses are under a huge number of important constraints and serve many important functions beyond implementing computationally complex functions at inference time). I've seen zero candidates for useful purposes for such an incredible amount of local computation with negligible quantities of long-distance communication, and there are very few examples of human-designed computations structured in this way / it seems to involve an extremely implausible model of what neurons are doing (apparently some nearly-embarassingly parallelizable task with work concentrated in individual neurons?). I don't really want to argue with this at length, but want to flag that you are very confident about it and it drives a large part of your estimate whereas something like 50-50 seems more appropriate even before updating on the empirical success of ML.</li><li>In general you seem to be making the case very unnecessarily conjunctive---you are asking how likely it is that we will find algorithms as good as the brain, and then <strong>also</strong> build computers that operate at the Landauer limit (as you are apparently confident the brain does), and then <strong>also</strong> deploy AI in a way that is competitive at a $25/hour price point, and so on. But in fact one of these areas can outperform your benchmark (and if you are right in this section, then it's definitely the case that we are radically more efficient than biology on many tasks already!), and it seems like you are dropping a lot of probability by ignoring that possibility. It's like asking about the probability that a sum of 5 normal distributions will be above the mean, and estimating it's 1/2^5 because each of 5 normal distributions needs to be above its mean.</li></ul><p>(<strong>ETA: </strong>this<strong> </strong>criticism of section 3 is unfair: you do discuss the prospect of much better than human performance in the 2-page section \"On the computational intensity of AGI,\" and indeed this plays a completely central role in your bottom line estimate. But I'm still left wondering what the earlier 60% and 40% (and all the other numbers!) are supposed to represent, given that you are apparently putting all the work of \"maybe humans will design efficient algorithms that are as good as the brain\" in this section. You also don't really discuss existing experience, where your estimates already appear to be many orders of magnitude off in domains where it is easiest to make comparisons between biology and ML (like vision or classical control) and where I don't see how to argue we aren't already 1000x better than biology using your 10 million flops per synapse number. Aside from me disagreeing with your mean, you describe these as conservative error bars since they put 20% probability on 1000x improvements over biology, but I think that's really not the case given that it includes uncertainty about the useful compute done by the brain (where you already disagree by &gt;&gt;3 OOMs with plausible estimates) as well as algorithmic progress (where 1000x improvements over 20 years seem common both within software and ML).)</p><p>I'll stop here rather than going on to sections 4+, though I think I have a lot to object to along similar lines (primarily that the story is being made unreasonably conjunctive).</p><p>Overall your estimation strategy looks crazy to me and I'm skeptical of the the implicit claim that this kind of methodology would perform well in historical examples. That said, if this sort of methodology actually does work well in practice then I think that trumps some a priori speculation and would be an important thing for me to really absorb. Your personal forecasting successes seem like a big part of the evidence for that, so it might be helpful to understand what kinds of predictions were involved and how methodologically analogous they are. Superficially it looks like the SciCast technology forecasting tournament is by far the most relevant; is there a pointer to the list of questions (other info like participants and list of predictions would also be awesome if available)?

Doesn't each of those factors on its own explain the difficulty of self-driving?

Driving uses quite a lot of the functions that human brains are well-adapted to perform---perception, prediction, planning, control. If we call it one tenth of a brain, that's 1e16 flops. Whereas I think existing self-driving cars use closer to 1e14 flops.

I'll respond piece by piece. I'll also try to highlight the things you think we believe but don't actually believe.</p><h3>Section 1: Likelihood of AGI algorithms</h3><blockquote><p><i>\"Can you say what exactly you are assigning a 60% probability to, and why it's getting multiplied with ten other factors? Are you saying that there is a 40% chance that by 2043 AI algorithms couldn't yield AGI no matter how much serial time and compute they had available? (It seems surprising to claim that even by 2023!) Presumably not that, but what exactly are you giving a 60% chance?</i></p></blockquote><p>Yes, we assign a 40% chance that we don't have AI algorithms by 2043 capable of learning to do nearly any human task with realistic amounts of time and compute. Some things we probably agree on:</p><ul><li>Progress has been promising and investment is rising.</li><li>Obviously the development of AI that can do AI research more cheaply than humans could be a huge accelerant, with the magnitude depending on the value-to-cost ratio. Already GPT-4 is accelerating my own software productivity, and future models over the next twenty years will no doubt be leagues better (as well as more efficient).</li><li>Obviously slow progress in the past is not great evidence of slow progress in the future, as any exponential curve shows.</li></ul><p>But as we discuss in the essay, 20 years is not a long time, much easier problems are taking longer, and there's a long track record of AI scientists being overconfident about the pace of progress (counterbalanced, to be sure, by folks on the other side who are overconfident about things that would not be achieved and subsequently were). These factors give us pause, so while agree it's likely we'll have algorithms for AGI by 2043, we're not certain of it, which is why we forecast 60%. We think forecasts higher than 60% are completely reasonable, but we personally struggle to justify anything near 100%.</p><p>Incidentally, I'm puzzled by your comment and others that suggest we might already have algorithms for AGI in 2023. Perhaps we're making different implicit assumptions of realistic compute vs infinite compute, or something else. To me, it feels clear we don't have the algorithms and data for AGI at present.</p><blockquote><p><i>(ETA: after reading later sections more carefully I think you might be saying 60% chance that our software is about as good as nature's, and maybe implicitly assuming there is a ~0% chance of being significantly better than that or building TAI without that? I'm not sure if that's right though, if so it's a huge point of methodological disagreement. I'll return to this point later.)\"</i></p></blockquote><p>Lastly, no, we emphatically do not assume a ~0% chance that AGI will be smarter than nature's brains. That feels like a ridiculous and overconfident thing to believe, and it pains me that we gave this impression. Already GPT-4 is smarter than me in ways, and as time goes on, the number of ways AI is smarter than me will undoubtedly grow.</p><h3>Section 2: Likelihood of fast reinforcement training</h3><blockquote><p><i>10 years is sufficient for humans to learn most physical skills from scratch, and you are talking about 20 year timelines. So why is the serial time for learning even a candidate blocker?</i></p></blockquote><p>Agree - if we had AGI today, this would not be a blocker. This becomes a greater and greater blocker the later AGI is developed. E.g., if AGI is developed in 2038, we'd have only 4 years to train it to do nearly every human task. So this factor is heavily entangled with the timeline on which AGI is developed.</p><p>(And obviously the development of AGI is not going to a clean line passed on a particular year, but the idea is the same even applied to AGI systems developed gradually and unevenly.)</p><blockquote><p><i>We can easily run tens of thousands of copies of AI systems in parallel. Existing RL is massively parallelizable. Human evolution gives no evidence about the difficulty of parallelizing learning in this way.

I think the crux on which we differ is that we think interaction with the real world will be a substantial bottleneck (and therefore being able to run 10,000 parallel copies may not save us).<br><br>As I mentioned to Zach below:</p><blockquote><p>With AlphaZero in particular, fast reinforcement training is possible because (a) the game state can be efficiently modeled by a computer and (b) the reward can be efficiently computed by a computer.</p><p>In contrast, look at a task like self-driving.

But that only works to the extent that (a) our simulations reflect reality and (b) we have the compute resources to do so. And so real self-driving car companies are spending billions on fleets and human supervision in order to gather the necessary data. In general, if an AGI cannot easily and cheaply simulate reality, it will have to learn from real-world interactions. And to the extent that it needs to learn from interactions with the consequences of its earlier actions, that training will need to be sequential.</p><blockquote><p><i>This isn't super relevant to my mainline view, since in fact I think AI is <strong>much</strong> worse at learning quickly than humans and will likely be transformative way before reaching parity.</i></p></blockquote><p>Agreed. Our expectation is that early AGIs will be expensive and uneven. If they end up being incredibly sample efficient, then this task will be much easier than we've forecasted.</p><p>In general, I'm pretty open to updating higher here. I don't think there are any insurmountable barriers here; but a sense that this will both be hard to do (as self-driving illustrates) as well as unlikely to be done (as all sorts of tasks not currently automated illustrate). My coauthor is a bit more negative on this factor than me and may chime in with his own thoughts later.</p><p>I personally struggle to imagine how an AlphaZero-like algorithm would learn to become the world's best swim instructor via massively parallelized reinforcement learning on children, but that may well be a failure of my imagination. Certainly one route is massively parallelized RL to become excellent at AI R&amp;D, then massively parallelized RL to become excellent at many tasks, and then quickly transferring that understanding to teaching children to swim, without any children ever drowning.</p><h3>Section 3: Operating costs</h3><p>Here, I think you ascribe many beliefs to us which we do not hold, and I apologize for not being clearer. I'll start by emphasizing what we do <i>not</i> believe.</p><blockquote><p><i>Overall you seem to think it is possible that AI will be as effective as brains but unlikely to be much better.</i></p></blockquote><p>We do not believe this.</p><p>AI is <i>already</i> vastly better than human brains at some tasks, and the number of tasks on which AI is superhuman will rise with time. We do expect that early AGIs will be expensive and uneven, as all earliest versions of a technology are. And then they will improve from there.</p><blockquote><p><i>just to be clear you are saying that [GPT-3] should behave like a brain with ~1000 neurons.</i></p></blockquote><p>We do not believe this.</p><blockquote><p><i>Your biological analysis seems to hinge on the assertion that precise simulation of neurons is necessary to get similar levels of computational utility</i></p></blockquote><p>We do not believe this.</p><blockquote><p><i>build computers that operate at the Landauer limit (as you are apparently confident the brain does)</i></p></blockquote><p>We do not believe this. We do not believe that brains operate at the Landauer limit, nor do we believe computers will operate at this limit by 2043.</p><p>Incidentally, I studied the Landauer limit deeply during my physics PhD and could write an essay on the many ways it's misinterpreted, but will save that for another day. :)</p><blockquote><p><i>It's like asking about the probability that a sum of 5 normal distributions will be above the mean, and estimating it's 1/2^5 because each of 5 normal distributions needs to be above its mean.</i></p></blockquote><p>We do not believe this.</p><p>To multiply these probabilities together, one cannot multiply their unconditional expectations; rather, one must multiply their cascading conditional probabilities. You may disagree with our probabilities, but our framework specifically addresses this point. Our <i>unconditional</i> probabilities are far lower for some of these events, because we believe they will be rapidly accelerated conditional on progress in AGI.</p><h3>Forecasting credentials</h3><blockquote><p><i>Your personal forecasting successes seem like a big part of the evidence for that, so it might be helpful to understand what kinds of predictions were involved and how methodologically analogous they are. Superficially it looks like the SciCast technology forecasting tournament is by far the most relevant; is there a pointer to the list of questions (other info like participants and list of predictions would also be awesome if available)? Or do you think one of the other items is more relevant?</i></p></blockquote><p>Honestly, I wouldn't put too much weight on my forecasting success. It's mostly a mix of common sense, time invested, and luck. I do think it reflects a decent mental model of how the world works, which leads to decent calibration for what's 3% likely vs 30% likely. The main reason I mention it in the paper is just to help folks realize that we're not wackos predicting 1% because we \"really feel\" confident. In many other situations (e.g., election forecasting, sports betting, etc.) I often find myself on the humble and uncertain side of the fence, trying to warn people that the world is more complicated and unpredictable than their gut is telling them. Even here, I consider our component forecasts quite uncertain, ranging from 16% to 95%. It's precisely our uncertainty about the future which leads to a small product of 0.4%. (From my point of view, you are staking out a much higher confidence position in asserting that AGI algorithms is very likely and that rapid self-improvement is very likely.)</p><p>As for SciCast, here's at least one publication that resulted from the project: <a href=\"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7266786\">https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7266786</a><br><br>Example questions (from memory) included:</p><ul><li>What will be the highest reported efficiency of a perovskite photovoltaic cell by date X</li><li>What will be the volume of deployed solar in the USA by date X</li><li>At the Brazil World Cup, how far will the paraplegic exoskeleton kick the ball for the opening kickoff</li><li>Will Amazon offer drone delivery by date X</li><li>Will physicists discover Y by date X</li></ul><p>Most forecasts related to scientific discoveries and technological inventions and had timescales of months to years.</p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>From your comment, I think the biggest crux between us is the rate of AI self-improvement. If the rate is lower, the world may look like what we're envisioning. If the rate is higher, progress may take off in a way not well predicted by current trends, and the world may look more like what you're envisioning. This causes our conditional probabilities to look too low and too independent, from your point of view. Do you think that's a fair assessment?</p><p>Lastly, can I kindly ask what your cascading conditional probabilities would be in our framework? (Let's hold the framework constant for this question, even if you prefer another.)</p><blockquote><p>If you disagree with our admittedly imperfect guesses, we kindly ask that you supply your own preferred probabilities (or framework modifications).

I predicted:</p><ul><li>100% that self-driving is solvable (looks correct)</li><li>90% that self-driving cars will not be available for sale by 2025 (looks correct)</li><li>90% that self-driving cars will debut as taxis years before sale to individuals (looks correct)</li><li>Rollout will be slow and done city-by-city, starting in the US (looks correct)</li></ul><p>Today I regularly take Cruises around SF and it seems decently likely that self-driving taxis are on track to be widely deployed across the USA by 2030. Feels pretty probable, but still plenty of ways that it could be delayed or heterogenous (e.g., regulation, stalling progress, unit economics).</p><p>Plus, even wide robotaxi deployment doesn't mean human taxi drivers are rendered obsolete. Seems very plausible we operate for many many years with a mixed fleet, where AI taxis with high fixed cost and low marginal cost serve baseload taxi demand while human taxis with lower fixed cost but higher marginal cost serve peak evening and commuter demand. In general it seems likely that as AI gets better we will see more complementary mixing and matching where AIs and humans are partnered to take advantage of their comparative advantages.</p><p>What counts as human-level is a bit fuzzier: is that human-level crash rates? human-level costs? human-level ability to deal with weird long tail situations?</p><p>On the specific question of random tourist vs self-driving vehicle in a <i>new</i> city, I predict that today the tourist is better (&gt;99%) and that by 2030 I'd still give the edge to the tourist (75%), acknowledging that the closer it gets the more the details of the metric begin to matter.</p><p>Overall there's some connection between self-driving progress and my AGI forecasts.</p><ul><li>If most cars and trucks are not self-driving by 2043, then it seems likely that we haven't achieved human-level human-cost AGI, and that would be a strong negative update.</li><li>If self-driving taxis still struggle with crowded parking lots and rare situations by 2030, that would a negative update.</li><li>If self-driving taxis are widely deployed across the US by 2030, but personal self-driving vehicles and self-driving taxis across Earth remain rare, that would be in line with my current worldview. Neutral update.</li><li>If self-driving improves and by 2030 becomes superhuman across a wide variety of driving metrics (i.e., not just crash rates, which can be maximized at the expense of route choice, speed, etc.), then that would be a positive update.</li><li>If self-driving improves by 2030 to the point that it can quickly learn to drive in new areas with new signage or new rules (i.e., we see a rapid expansion across all countries), that would be unexpected and a strong positive update on AGI.</li></ul><blockquote><p><i><strong>ETA:</strong> let me try to make the point about self-driving cars more sharply. You seem to think there's a &lt;15% chance that by 2043 we can do what a human brain can do even using 1e17 flops (a 60% chance of \"having the algorithms\" and a 20% chance of being 3 OOMs better than 1e20 flops). Driving uses quite a lot of the functions that human brains are well-adapted to perform---perception, prediction, planning, control. If we call it one tenth of a brain, that's 1e16 flops. Whereas I think existing self-driving cars use closer to 1e14 flops. So shouldn't you be pretty much shocked if self-driving cars could be made to work using any amount of data with so little computing hardware? How can you be making meaningful updates from the fact that they don't?</i></p></blockquote><p>Excellent argument. Maybe we should update on that, though I find myself resistant. Part of my instinctive justification against updating is that current self-driving AIs, even if they achieve human-ish level crash rates, are still very sub-human in terms of:</p><ul><li>Time to learn to drive</li><li>Ability to deal with complex situations like crowded parking lots</li><li>Ability to deal with rare situations like a firefighter waving you in a particular direction &nbsp;near a burning car</li><li>Ability to deal with custom signage</li><li>Ability to deal with unmapped routes</li><li>Ability to explain why they did what they did</li><li>Ability to reason about things related to driving</li><li>Ability to deal with heavy snow, fog, inclement weather</li></ul><p>It feels quite plausible to me that these abilities could \"cost\" orders of magnitude of compute. I really don't know.</p><p>Edit: Or, you could make the same argument about walking. E.g., maybe it engages 10% of our brain in terms of spatial modeling and prediction. But then there are all sorts of animals with much smaller brains that are still able to walk, right? So maybe navigation, at a crude level of ability, really needs much less than 10% of human intelligence.

We just don't get to observe how easy problems are if you have plenty of compute, and it seems increasingly clear that weak performance is often explained by limited compute. In fact, even if 60% is your estimate for \"doable with similar compute to the brain,\" I don't see why you are updating from our failure to do tasks with orders of magnitude less compute than a brain (even before considering that you think individual neurons are incredibly potent).</p><blockquote><h3>Section 2: Likelihood of fast reinforcement training</h3></blockquote><p>I still don't fully understand the claims being made in this section. I guess you are saying that there's a significant chance that the serial time requirements will be large and that will lead to a large delay?

It seems like if you had human-level learning (as we are conditioning on from sections 1+3) then things would probably work in &lt;2 years unless parallelization is surprisingly inefficient. And even setting aside the comparison to humans, such large serial bottlenecks aren't really consistent with any evidence to date.

You also talk about some low level dynamics without trying to explain why they may be computationally relevant. And then you give pretty confident estimates for the useful computation done in a brain. Could you fill in the missing steps in that estimate a bit more, both for the mean (of 1e6 per neuron*spike) and for the standard deviation of the log (which seems to be about ~1 oom)?</p><blockquote><p><i>build computers that operate at the Landauer limit (as you are apparently confident the brain does)</i></p></blockquote><p>I think I misunderstood your claims somehow.</p><p>I think you are claiming that the brain does 1e20-1e21 flops of useful computation. I don't know exactly how you are comparing between brains and floating point operations. A floating point operation is more like 1e5 bit erasures today and is necessarily at least 16 bit erasures at fp16 (and your estimates don't allow for large precision reductions e.g. to 1 bit arithmetic). Let's call it 1.6e21 bit erasures per second, I think quite conservatively?</p><p>I might be totally wrong about the Landauer limit, but I made this statement by looking at Wikipedia which claims 3e-21 J per bit erasure at room temperature. So if you multiply that by 1.6e21 bit erasures per second, isn't that 5 W, nearly half the power consumption of the brain?</p><p>Is there a mistake somewhere in there?

Talking about conditional probabilities doesn't help.</p><p>Are you saying that e.g. a war between China and Taiwan makes it impossible to build AGI? Or that serial time requirements make AGI impossible? Or that scaling chips means AGI is impossible? It seems like each of these just makes it harder. These are factors you should be adding up. Some things can go wrong and you can still get AGI by 2043. If you want to argue you can't build AGI if something goes wrong, that's a whole different story. So multiplying probabilities (even conditional probabilities) for none of these things happening doesn't seem right.</p><blockquote><p>Lastly, can I kindly ask what your cascading conditional probabilities would be in our framework? (Let's hold the framework constant for this question, even if you disagree with it.)</p></blockquote><p>I don't know what the events in your decomposition refer to well enough to assign them probabilities:</p><ul><li>I still don't know what \"algorithms for AGI\" means. I think you are somehow ignoring compute costs, but if so I don't know on what basis you are making any kind of generalization from our experience with the difficulty of designing extremely fast algorithms. In most domains algorithmic issues are ~the whole game and that seems true in AI as well.</li><li>I don't really know what \"invent a way for AGI to learn faster than humans\" means, as distinct from the estimates in the next section about the cost of AGI algorithms. Again, are you trying to somehow abstract out compute costs of learning here? Then my probabilities are very but uninteresting.</li><li>Taken on its own, it seems like the third probability (\"AGI inference costs drop below $25/hr (per human equivalent)\") implies the conclusion. So I assume you are doing something where you say \"Ignoring increases in demand and the possibility of supply chain disruptions and...\" or something like that? So the forecast you are making about compute prices aren't unconditional forecasts?</li><li>I don't know what level of cheap, quality robots you refer to. The quality of robotics needed to achieve transformative AI depends completely on the quality of your AI. For powerful AI it can be done with existing robot bodies, for weak AI it would need wildly superhuman bodies, at intermediate levels it can be done if humanoid robots cost millions of dollars each. And conversely the previous points aren't really defined unless you specify something about the robotic platform. I assume you address this in the section but I think it's going to be hard to define enough that I can give a number.</li><li>I don't know what massively scaling chips mean---again, it seems like this just depends crucially on how good your algorithms are. It feels more like you should be estimating multiple numbers and then seeing the probability that the product is large enough to be impactful.</li><li>I don't know what \"avoid derailment\" means. It seems like these are just factors that affect the earlier estimates, so I guess the earlier quantities were supposed to be something like \"the probability of developing AGI given that nothing weird happens in the world\"? Or something? But weird stuff is guaranteed to be happening in the world. I feel like this is the same deal as above, you should be multiplying out factors.</li></ul><blockquote><p>From your comment, I think the biggest crux between us is the rate of AI self-improvement. If the rate is lower, the world may look like what we're envisioning. If the rate is higher, progress may take off in a way not well predicted by current trends, and the world may look more like what you're envisioning.

The AIs would be wrong to conclude that humans have slow economic growth because we can't do some tasks that AIs are great at, and the humans would be wrong to conclude that AIs will have slow economic growth because they can't do some tasks we are great at. The exact comparison is only relevant for assessing things like complementarity, which make large impacts happen strictly more quickly than they would otherwise.</p><p>(This might be related to me disliking AGI though, and then it's kind of on OpenPhil for asking about it.

I'm certainly no expert on visual processing in the human brain. Let me flesh out some of my thoughts here.</p><h3><strong>On whether this framework would have yielded bad forecasts for self-driving:</strong></h3><p>When we guess that brains use 1e20-1e21 FLOPS, and therefore that early AGIs might need 1e16-1e25, we're not making a claim about AGIs in general, or the most efficient AGI possible, but AGIs by 2043. We expect early AGIs to be horribly inefficient by later standards, and AGIs to get rapidly more efficient over time. AGI in 2035 will be less efficient than AGI in 2042 which will be less efficient than AGI in 2080.</p><p>With that clarification, let's try to apply our logic to self-driving to see whether it bears weight.</p><p>Supposing that self-driving needs 1% of human brainpower, or 1e18-1e19 FLOPS, and then similarly widen our uncertainty to 1e14-1e23 FLOPS, it might say yes, we'd be surprised but not stunned at 1e14 FLOPS being enough to drive (10% -&gt; 100%). But, and I know my reasoning is motivated here, that actually seems kind of reasonable? Like, for the first decade and change of trying, 1e14 FLOPS actually was not enough to drive. Even now, it's beginning to be enough to drive, but still is wildly less sample efficient than human drivers and wildly worse at generalizing than human drivers. So it feels like if in 2010 we predicted self-driving would take 1e14-1e23 FLOPS, and then a time traveler from the future told us that actually it was 1e14 FLOPS, but it would take 13 years to get there, and actually would still be subhuman, then honestly that doesn't feel too shocking. It was the low end of the range, took many years, and still didn't quite match human performance.</p><p>No doubt with more time and more training 1e14 FLOPS will become more and more capable. Just as we have little doubt that with more time AGIs will require fewer and fewer FLOPS to achieve human performance.</p><p>So as I reflect on this framework applied to the test case of self-driving, I come away thinking (a) it actually would have made reasonable predictions and (b) in hindsight I think we should have spent some pages modeling rates of AGI progress, as (obviously) AGI needs are not a fixed target but will decline rapidly over time.</p><p>In sum, it's not obvious to me that this logic would have generated bad predictions for self-driving, and so I'm still unconvinced that we've made a big blunder here.</p><h3><strong>On whether driving takes 1% of the human brain:</strong></h3><p>I'm going to go way outside my lane here, no pun intended, and I welcome comments from those more informed.</p><p>From my very brief Googling, sources say that something like half the brain is involved in vision, though that includes vision+motor, vision+attention, vision+spatial, etc. Going out on a limb, it seems if one knew that fact alone, they might feel reasonable saying that if we can solve vision, then AGI will only need twice as much compute, as vision is half of our brainpower. But it feels like we've made massive progress in vision (AlexNet, self-driving, etc.) without being on the cusp of AGI. Somehow even though the brain does lots of vision, these visual identification benchmarks feel far short of AGI.</p><p>My feeling is that what makes the human brain superior to today's AI is its ability to generalize from few examples. To illustrate, suppose you take an AI and a human and you train them over and over to drive a route from A to B. With 1e14 FLOPS and enough training, the AI may be able to eventually outperform the human. But now test the AI and human on route C to D. &nbsp;The human will be wildly better, as their pre-trained world model will have prevented overfitting to the features of route AB. The je ne sais quoi of our intelligence seems to be that we are better able to build models of the world that allow us to more easily reason and generalize to new situations.</p><p>To me, getting 1e14 FLOPS to drive a route AB and nothing else is a monumentally different challenge than getting 1e14 FLOPS to drive a route AB, plus any other hypothetical route you throw at it. The first is narrow intelligence. The second is general intelligence. So if we discover that an AI can self-drive route AB with only 1e14 FLOPS, should it be a giant update for how much compute AGI will need? I think it depends: if it's a narrow brittle overfit AI, then no. If it's a general (in the sense of general to any road) robust AI, then yes, it should be a big update.</p><p>So where does self-driving lay? Well, obviously self-driving cars with 1e14 FLOPS are able to generalize well to all sorts of pre-mapped and pre-simulated routes in a city. But at the same time, they appear to generalize pretty poorly overall - I wouldn't expect a Waymo vehicle to generalize well to a new city, let alone a new country.</p><p>Summarizing, I think the impressiveness of only needing 1e14 FLOPS to drive is really dependent on how well that driving generalizes. If it can generalize as well as human drivers, yes, that's a big update that AGI may need less 1e20-1e21 FLOPS. But today's self-driving doesn't cross that bar for me. It's quite brittle, and so I am less inclined to update.&nbsp;</p><p>Put another way, perhaps brittle self-driving takes 0.1% of human brainpower and robust self-driving takes 10% of human brainpower. Or something like that, who knows. It's really not clear to me that self-driving in general needs 1% of the human brain, if that self-driving generalizes very poorly to new situations.</p><p>Lastly, there is typically going to be a tradeoff between training compute and inference compute. If 1e14 FLOPS is enough to self-drive, but only with millions of miles driven and billions of miles simulated, that should far be less impressive than 1e14 FLOPS being enough to drive after only 100 miles of training. For all I know, it may be possible to get a good driver that only uses 1e12 FLOPS if we train it on even more compute and data; e.g., a billion miles of driving and a trillion miles of simulation. But even if that loosely extrapolates to AGI, it's only useful if we can afford the \"brain equivalent\" of a billion miles of training. If that's too costly, then the existence proof of a 1e12 FLOPS driver may be moot in terms of analogizing AGI inference costs. It's a pretty interesting question and we certainly could have added more modeling and discussion to our already lengthy essay.</p>", "parentCommentId": "dgqNqgfLa35fCPJpq", "user": {"username": "Ted Sanders"}}, {"_id": "jjpQ5XogBpT2G6BHP", "postedAt": "2023-06-07T06:52:38.551Z", "postId": "ARkbWch5RMsj6xP5p", "htmlBody": "<p>To me, the odds of pandemic and wars and regulation feel decently independent, but perhaps I haven't thought deeply enough about pandemics causing depressions causing wars, or wars leading to engineered pandemics being released, etc.</p><p>Looking at the past 100ish years of history, the worst wars (world war I &amp; II), the worst pandemics (various flus, COVID19), and the worst recessions (great depression, great recession) all seem fairly independent.</p><p>In any case, we tried our best to come up with probabilities of each, conditional on the others not occurring.</p><p>What probabilities would you assign?</p><p>As we asked in our post:</p><blockquote><p><i>If you disagree with our admittedly imperfect guesses, we kindly ask that you supply your own preferred probabilities (or framework modifications).

I see in the paper that it mentions humans being sequential learners that takes years, but AIs don't seem to work that way. Imagine if GPT4 took years just to learn basic words. AIs also seem to already be able to learn faster than humans. They currently need more data, but less compute than a human brain. Computers can already process information much faster than a brain. And you don't even need them to learn faster than humans, since once they learn a task, they can just copy that skill to all other AIs. This is a critical point. A human will spend years in Med School just because a senior in the field can't copy their weights and send them to a grad student.</p><p>Also, I'm confused how this at .4, given that its conditional of TAI happening. If you have algorithms for TAI, why couldn't they also invent algorithms that learn faster than humans? We already see how current AIs can improve algorithmic efficiency (as just one recent example: https://www.deepmind.com/blog/alphadev-discovers-faster-sorting-algorithms).

These aren't mechanical humans, they don't need to go through repeated training, knowledge expertise, etc. They only need to do it once, and then it just gets copied.</p><p>And, like above, if this is conditional on TAI and faster-than-human learning occurring, how is this only at .016?

I don't think progress will be discontinuous, and I do think we will see increasingly capable and useful systems by 2030 and 2035 that accelerate rates of progress.</p><p>I think where we may differ is that:</p><ul><li>I think the acceleration will likely be more \"in line\" than \"out of line\" with the exponential acceleration we already see from improving computer tools and specifically LLM computer tools (e.g., GitHub Copilot, GPT-4). Already a software engineer today is many multiples more productive (by some metrics) than a software engineer in the 90s.</li><li>I think that tools that, say, cheaply automate half of work, or expensively automate 100% work probably won't lead to wild, extra orders of magnitude levels of progress. OpenAI has what, 400 employees?<ul><li>Scenario one: If half their work was automated, ok now those 400 people could do the work of 800 people. That's great, but honestly I don't think it's path-breaking. And sure, that's only the first order effect. If half the work was automated, we'd of course elastically start spending way much more on the cheap automated half. But on the other hand, there would be diminishing returns, and for every step that becomes free, we just hit bottlenecks in the hard to automate parts. Even in the limit of cheap AGI, those AGIs may be limited by the GPUs they have to experiment on. Labor becoming free just means capital is the constraint.</li><li>Scenario two: Or, suppose we have human-cost human-level AGIs. I'm not convinced that would, to first order, change much either. There are millions of smart people on earth who aren't working on AI research now. We could hire them, but we don't. We're not limited by brains. We're limited by willingness to spend. So even if we invent human-cost human-level brains, it actually doesn't change much, because that wasn't the constraint. (Of course, this is massively oversimplifying, and obviously human-cost human-level AGIs would be a bigger deal than human workers because of their ability to be rapidly improved and copied. But I hope it nevertheless conveys why I think AGI will need to get close to transformative levels before growth really explodes.)</li></ul></li></ul><p>Overall where it feels like I'm differing from some folks here is that I think higher levels of AI capability will be needed before we get wild self-improvement takeoff. I don't think it will be early, because even if we get massive automation due to uneven AI we'll still be bottlenecked by the things it's bad at. I acknowledge this is a pretty squishy argument and I find it difficult to quantify and articulate, so I think it's quite reasonable to disagree with me here. In general though, I think we've seen a long history of things being harder to automate than we thought (e.g., self-driving, radiology, etc.).

If half the work was automated, we'd of course elastically start spending way much more on the cheap automated half. But on the other hand, there would be diminishing returns, and for every step that becomes free, we just hit bottlenecks in the hard to automate parts. Even in the limit of cheap AGI, those AGIs may be limited by the GPUs they have to experiment on.

We're not limited by brains. We're limited by willingness to spend. So even if we invent human-cost human-level brains, it actually doesn't change much, because that wasn't the constraint. (Of course, this is massively oversimplifying, and obviously human-cost human-level AGIs would be a bigger deal than human workers because of their ability to be rapidly improved and copied.

As mentioned I disagree with your 0.7 war derailment. Upon further thought I don't necessarily disagree with your 0.7 \"regulation derailment\", but I think that in most cases where I'm talking to people about AI risk, I'd want to factor this out (because I typically want to make claims like \"here's what happens if we don't do something about it\").&nbsp;</p><p>Anyway, the \"derailment\" part isn't really the key disagreement here. The key disagreement is methodological. Here's one concrete alternative methodology which I think is better: a more symmetric model which involves three estimates:</p><ol><li>Probability of us developing TAGI, assuming that nothing extreme happens</li><li>Probability of us being derailed, conditional on otherwise being on track to develop TAGI</li><li>Probability of us being rerailed, conditional on otherwise <i>not</i> being on track to develop TAGI</li></ol><p>By \"rerailed\" here I mean roughly \"something as extreme as a derailment happens, but in a way which pushes us over the threshold to be on track towards TAGI by 2043\". Some possibilities include:</p><ol><li>An international race towards AGI, akin to the space race or race towards nukes</li><li>A superintelligent but expensive AGI turns out to good enough at science to provide us with key breakthroughs</li><li>Massive economic growth superheats investment into TAGI</li></ol><p>Suppose we put 5% credence on each of these \"rerailing\" us. Then our new calculation (using your numbers) would be:</p><p>The chance of being on track assuming that nothing extreme happens: 0.6*0.4*0.16*0.6*0.46 = 1%</p><p>P(no derailment conditional on being on track) = 0.7*0.9*0.7*0.9*0.95 = 38%</p><p>P(rerailment conditional on not being on track) = 1 - 0.95*0.95*0.95 = 14%</p><p>P(TAGI by 2043) = 0.99*0.14 + 0.01*0.38 = 14.2%</p><p>That's over 30x higher than your original estimate, and totally changes your conclusions! So presumably you must think either that there's something wrong with the structure I've used here, or else that 5% is way too high for each of those three rerailments. But I've tried to make the rerailments as analogous to the derailments as possible. For example, if you think a depression could <i>derail</i> us, then it seems pretty plausible that the opposite of a depression could <i>rerail</i> us using approximately the same mechanisms.</p><p>You might say \"look, the chance of being on track to hit all of events 1-5 by 2043 is really low. This means that in worlds where we're on track, we're probably barely on track; whereas in worlds where we're not on track, we're often missing it by decades. This makes derailment much easier than rerailment.\" Which... yeah, conditional on your numbers for events 1-5, this seems true. But the low likelihood of being on track also means that even very low rerailment probabilities could change your final estimate dramatically\u2014e.g. even 1% for each of the rerailments above would increase your headline estimate by almost an order of magnitude. And I do think that many people would interpret a headline claim of \"&lt;1%\" as pretty different from \"around 3%\".</p><p>Having said that, speaking for myself, I don't care very much about &lt;1% vs 3%; I care about 3% vs 30% vs 60%. The difference between <i>those </i>is going to primarily depend on events 1-5, not on derailments or rerailments. I have been trying to avoid getting into the weeds on that, since everyone else has been doing so already. So I'll just say the following: to me, events 1-5 all look pretty closely related. \"Way better algorithms\" and \"far more rapid learning\" and \"cheaper inference\" and \"better robotic control\" all seem in some sense to be different facets of a single underlying trend; and chip + power production will both contribute to that trend and also be boosted by that trend. And so, because of this, it seems likely to me that there are alternative factorizations which are less disjoint and therefore get very different results. I think this was what Paul was getting at, but that discussion didn't seem super productive, so if I wanted to engage more with it a better approach might be to just come up with my own alternative factorization and then argue about whether it's better or worse than yours.
