Even if you do take the work of x-philers for granted, it's not the sort of thing that can be done merely with education in psychology and neuroscience, because people who understand that side of the story but not the actual philosophy are going to be unable to evaluate or make the substantive moral arguments which are necessary for empirically informed work.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": "hKkYyCpLuNX5DufbM", "user": {"username": "kbog"}}, {"_id": "3eGRpyq8DkArajPj3", "postedAt": "2017-06-07T00:04:32.377Z", "postId": "WdMnmmqqiP5zCtSfv", "htmlBody": "<p>Also, have you seen this <a href=\"http://aiimpacts.org/tom-griffiths-on-cognitive-science-and-ai/\">AI Impacts post</a> and the interview it links to?

The trolley literature is rife with attempts to vindicate an unwillingness to push, because these philosophers are starting from the assumption that commonsense moral intuitions track deep moral truths and we must explicate the underlying, implicit justification our moral competence is picking up on.</p>\n<p>What Greene is doing by appealing to neuroscientific/psychological evidence is to offer a selective debunking explanation of some of those intuitions but not the others. If the evidence demonstrates that one set of outputs (deontological judgments) are the result of an unreliable cognitive process, and another set of outputs (utilitarian judgments) are the result of reliable cognitive processes, then he can show that we have reason to doubt one set of intuitions but not the other, provided we agree with his criteria about what constitutes a reliable vs. an unreliable process. A selective debunking argument of this kind, relying as it does on the reliability of distinct psychological systems or processes, does in fact turn on the empirical evidence (in this case, on his dual process model of moral cognition). </p>\n<p>[But nobody believes that judgements are correct or wrong merely because of the process that produces them.]</p>\n<p>Sure, but Greene does not need to argue that deontological/utilitarian conclusions are correct or incorrect, only that we have reason to doubt one but not the other.

Recent work by Kahane shows that people who push in footbridge scenarios tend not to be utilitarians, just people with low empathy. The same people that push tend to also be more egoistic, less charitable, less impartial, less concerned about maximizing welfare, etc. </p>\n<p>Regarding your last point two points: I agree that one move is to simply reject how he talks about intuitions (or one could raise other epistemic challenges presumably). I also agree that training in psychology/neuroscience but not philosophy impairs one's ability to evaluate arguments that presumably depend on competence in both.

If a machine superoptimizer\u2019s goal system is programmed to maximize pleasure, then it might, for example, tile the local universe with tiny digital minds running continuous loops of a single, maximally pleasurable experience. We can\u2019t predict exactly what a hedonistic utilitarian machine superoptimizer would do, but we think it seems likely to produce unintended consequences, for reasons we hope will become clear. [...]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Suppose \u201cpleasure\u201d was specified (in the machine superoptimizer\u2019s goal system) in terms of our current understanding of the human neurobiology of pleasure. Aldridge and Berridge (2009) report that according to \u201can emerging consensus,\u201d pleasure is \u201cnot a sensation\u201d but instead a \u201cpleasure gloss\u201d added to sensations by \u201chedonic hotspots\u201d in the ventral pallidum and other regions of the brain. A sensation is encoded by a particular pattern of neural activity, but it is not pleasurable in itself. To be pleasurable, the sensation must be \u201cpainted\u201d with a pleasure gloss represented by additional neural activity activated by a hedonic hotspot (Smith et al. 2009).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A machine superoptimizer with a goal system programmed to maximize human pleasure (in this sense) could use nanotechnology or advanced pharmaceuticals or neurosurgery to apply maximum pleasure gloss to all human sensations\u2014a scenario not unlike that of plugging us all into Nozick\u2019s experience machines (Nozick 1974, 45). Or, it could use these tools to restructure our brains to apply maximum pleasure gloss to one consistent experience it could easily create for us, such as lying immobile on the ground.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Or suppose \u201cpleasure\u201d was specified more broadly, in terms of anything that functioned as a reward signal\u2014whether in the human brain\u2019s dopaminergic reward system (Dreher and Tremblay 2009), or in a digital mind\u2019s reward signal circuitry (Sutton and Barto 1998). A machine superoptimizer with the goal of maximizing reward signal scores could tile its environs with trillions of tiny minds, each one running its reward signal up to the highest number it could.

Human desire is implemented by the dopaminergic reward system (Schroeder 2004; Berridge, Robinson, and Aldridge 2009), and a machine superoptimizer mizer could likely get more utility by (1) rewiring human neurology so that we attain maximal desire satisfaction while lying quietly on the ground than by (2) building and maintaining a planet-wide utopia that caters perfectly to current human preferences.

[...] </p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We cannot show that every moral theory yet conceived would produce substantially unwanted consequences if used in the goal system of a machine superoptimizer. Philosophers have been prolific in producing new moral theories, and we do not have the space here to consider the prospects (for use in the goal system of a machine superoptimizer) for a great many modern moral theories. These include rule utilitarianism (Harsanyi 1977), motive utilitarianism (Adams 1976), two-level utilitarianism (Hare 1982), prioritarianism (Arneson 1999), perfectionism (Hurka 1993), welfarist utilitarianism (Sen 1979), virtue consequentialism (Bradley 2005), Kantian consequentialism (Cummiskey 1996), global consequentialism (Pettit and Smith 2000), virtue theories (Hursthouse 2012), contractarian theories (Cudd 2008), Kantian deontology (R. Johnson 2010), and Ross\u2019 prima facie duties (Anderson, Anderson, and Armen 2006).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Yet the problem remains: the AI has to be programmed with <em>some</em> definition of what is good.</p>\n<p>Now this alone isn't yet sufficient to show that philosophy wouldn't be up to the task. But philosophy has been trying to solve ethics for at least the last 2500 years, and it doesn't look like there would have been any major progress towards solving it. The <a href=\"https://philpapers.org/archive/BOUWDP.pdf\">PhilPapers survey</a> didn't show any of the three major ethical schools (consequentialism, deontology, virtue ethics) being significantly more favored by professional philosophers than the others, nor does anyone - to my knowledge - even know what a decisive theoretical argument in favor of one of them <em>could</em> be.</p>\n<p>And at this point, we have pretty good theoretical reasons for believing that the traditional goal of moral philosophy - &quot;developing a set of explicit principles for telling us what is good&quot; - is in fact impossible. Or at least, it's impossible to develop a set of principles that would be simple and clear enough to write down in human-understandable form and which would give us clear answers to every situation, because morality is too complicated for that. </p>\n<p>We've already seen this in trying to define concepts: as philosophy noted a long time ago, you can't come up with a set of explicit rules that would define even any concept even as simple as &quot;man&quot; in such a way that nobody could develop a counterexample. &quot;The Normative Insignificance of Neuroscience&quot; also notes that the situation in ethics looks similar to the situation with trying to define many other concepts:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>... what makes the trolley problem so hard\u2014indeed, what has led some to despair of our ever finding a solution to it\u2014is that for nearly every principle that has been proposed to explain our intuitions about trolley cases, some ingenious person has devised a variant of the classic trolley scenario for which that principle yields counterintuitive results. Thus as with the Gettier literature in epistemology and the causation and personal identity literatures in metaphysics, increasingly baroque proposals have given way to increasingly complex counterexamples, and though some have continued to struggle with the trolley problem, many others have simply given up and moved on to other topics.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Yet human brains do manage to successfully reason with concepts, despite it being impossible to develop a set of explicit necessary and sufficient criteria. The evidence from both psychology and artificial intelligence (where we've managed to train neural nets capable of reasonably good object recognition) is that a big part of how they do it is by building up complicated statistical models of what counts as a &quot;man&quot; or &quot;philosopher&quot; or whatever.</p>\n<p>So given that</p>\n<ul>\n<li>we can't build explicit verbal models of what a concept is * but we can build machine-learning algorithms that use complicated statistical analysis to identify instances of a concept</li>\n</ul>\n<p>and</p>\n<ul>\n<li>defining morality looks similar to defining concepts, in that we can't build explicit verbal models of what morality is</li>\n</ul>\n<p>it would seem reasonable to assume that</p>\n<ul>\n<li>we can build machine-learning algorithms that can learn to define morality, in that it can give such answers to moral dilemmas that a vast majority of people would consider them acceptable</li>\n</ul>\n<p>But here it looks likely that we need information from psychology to narrow down what those models should be. What humans consider to be good has likely been influenced by a number of evolutionary idiosyncrasies, so if we want to come up with a model of morality that most humans would agree with, then our AI's reasoning process should take into account those considerations. And we've already established that defining those considerations on a verbal level looks insufficient - they have to be established on a deeper level, of &quot;what are the actual computational processes that are involved when the brain computes morality&quot;.</p>\n<p>Yes, I am here assuming &quot;what is good&quot; to equate to &quot;what do human brains consider good&quot;, in a way that may be seen as reducing to &quot;what would human brains accept as a persuasive argument for what is good&quot;. You could argue that this is flawed, because it's getting dangerously close to defining &quot;good&quot; by social consensus. But then again, the way the field of ethics itself proceeds is basically the same: a philosopher presents an argument for what is good, another attacks it, if the argument survives attacks and is compelling then it is eventually accepted. For empirical facts we can come up with objective tests, but for moral truths it looks to me unavoidable - due to the is-ought gap - that some degree of &quot;truth by social consensus&quot; <em>is</em> the only way of figuring out what the truth is, even in principle.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": "RJnNtq9ExWao3uveH", "user": {"username": "Kaj_Sotala"}}, {"_id": "TWAZEtQ7ELnoMrnJm", "postedAt": "2017-06-11T14:50:25.560Z", "postId": "WdMnmmqqiP5zCtSfv", "htmlBody": "<p>Also, I find pretty compelling the argument that the classical definition of moral philosophy in trying to <em>define</em> &quot;the good&quot; is both impossible and not even a particularly good target to aim at, and that trying to find generally-agreeable moral solutions is something much more useful; and if we accept this argument, then moral psychology is relevant, because it can help us figure out generally-agreeable solutions.</p>\n<p>As Martela (<a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/meta.12229/full\">2017</a>) writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>...there is a deeper point in Williams's book that is even harder to rebut. Williams asks: What can an ethical theory do, if we are able to build a convincing case for one? He is skeptical about the force of ethical considerations and reminds us that even if we were to have a justified ethical theory, the person in question might not be concerned about it. Even if we could prove to some amoralists that what they are about to do is (a) against some universal ethical standard, (b) is detrimental to their own well-being, and/or (c) is against the demands of rationality or internal coherence, they still have the choice of whether to care about this or not. They can choose to act even if they know that what they are about to do is against some standard that they believe in. Robert Nozick\u2014whom Williams quotes\u2014describes this as follows: \u201cSuppose that we show that some X he [the immoral man] holds or accepts or does commits him to behaving morally. He now must give up at least one of the following: (a) behaving immorally, (b) maintaining X, (c) being consistent about this matter in this respect. The immoral man tells us, \u2018To tell you the truth, if I had to make the choice, I would give up being consistent\u2019\u201d (Nozick 1981, 408).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>What Williams in effect says is that the noble task of finding ultimate justification for some ethical standards could not\u2014even if it was successful\u2014deliver any final argument in practical debates about how to behave. \u201cObjective truth\u201d would have only the motivational weight that the parties involved choose to give to it. It no longer is obvious what a philosophical justification of an ethical standard is supposed to do or even \u201cwhy we should need such a thing\u201d (Williams 1985, 23).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Yet when we look at many contemporary ethical debates, we can see that that they proceed as if the solutions to the questions they pose would matter. In most scientific disciplines the journal articles have a standard section called \u201cpractical bearings,\u201d where the practical relevance of the accumulated results are discussed. Not so for metaethical articles, even though they otherwise simulate the academic and peer-reviewed writing style of scientific articles. When we read someone presenting a number of technical counterarguments against quasi-realist solutions to the Frege-Geach problem, there usually is no debate about what practical bearings the discussion would have, whether these arguments would be successful or not. Suppose that in some idealized future the questions posed by the Frege-Geach problem would be conclusively solved. A new argument would emerge that all parties would see as so valid and sound that they would agree that the problem has now been finally settled. What then? How would ordinary people behave differently, after the solution has been delivered to them? I would guess it is fair to say\u2014at least until it is proven otherwise\u2014that the outcome of these debates is only marginally relevant for any ordinary person's ethical life. [...]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This understanding of morality means that we have to think anew what moral inquiry should aim at. [...] Whatever justification can be given for one moral doctrine over the other, it has to be found in practice\u2014simply because there are no other options available. Accordingly, for pragmatists, moral inquiry is in the end directed toward practice, its successfulness is ultimately judged by the practical bearings it has on people's experiences: \u201cUnless a philosophy is to remain symbolic\u2014or verbal\u2014or a sentimental indulgence for a few, or else mere arbitrary dogma, its auditing of past experience and its program of values must take effect in conduct\u201d (Dewey 1916, 315). Moral inquiry should thus aim at practice; its successfulness is ultimately measured by how it is able to influence people's moral outlook and behavior. [...]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Moral principles, ideals, rules, theories, or conclusions should thus be seen \u201cneither as a cookbook, nor a remote calculus\u201d (Pappas 1997, 546) but as instruments that we can use to understand our behavior and change it for the better. Instead of trying to <em>discover</em> the <em>correct</em> ethical theories, the task becomes one of <em>designing</em> the most <em>functional</em> ethical theories. Ethics serves certain functions in human lives and in societies, and the task is to improve its ability to serve these functions (Kitcher 2011b). In other words, the aim of ethical theorizing is to provide people with tools (see Hickman 1990, 113\u201314) that help them in living their lives in a good and ethically sound way. [...]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It is true that the lack of foundational principles in ethics denies the pragmatist moral philosopher the luxury of being objectively right in some moral question. In moral disagreements, a pragmatist cannot \u201csolve\u201d the disagreement by relying on some objective standards that deliver the \u201cright\u201d and final answer. But going back to Williams's argument raised at the beginning of this article, we can ask what would it help if we were to \u201csolve\u201d the problem. The other party still has the option to ignore our solution. Furthermore, despite the long history of ethics we still haven't found many objective standards or \u201cfinal solutions\u201d that everyone would agree on, and thus it seems that waiting for such standards to emerge is futile.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In practice, there seem to be two ways in which moral disagreements are resolved. First is brute force. In some moral disputes I am in a position in which I can force the other party to comply with my standards whether that other party agrees with me or not. The state with its monopoly on the legitimate use of violence can force its citizens to comply with certain laws even when the personal moral code of these citizens would disagree with the law. The second way to resolve a moral disagreement is to find some common ground, some standards that the other believes in, and start building from there a case for one's own position.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In the end, it might be beneficial that pragmatism annihilates the possibility of believing that I am absolutely right and the other party is absolutely wrong. As Margolis notes: \u201cThe most monstrous crimes the race has ever (been judged to have) perpetrated are the work of the partisans of \u2018right principles\u2019 and privileged revelation\u201d (1996, 213). Instead of dismissing the other's perspective as wrong, one must try to understand it in order to find common ground and shared principles that might help in progressing the dialogue around the problem. If one really wants to change the opinion of the other party, instead of invoking some objective standards one should invoke some standards that the other already believes in. This means that one has to listen to the other person, try to see the world from his or her point of view. Only through understanding the other's perspective one can have a chance to find a way to change it\u2014or to change one's own opinion, if this learning process should lead to that. One can aim to clarify the other's points of view, unveil their hidden assumptions and values, or challenge their arguments, but one must do this by drawing on principles and values that the other is already committed to if one wants to have a chance to have a real impact on the other's way of seeing the world, or actually to resolve the disagreement. I believe that this kind of approach, rather than a claim for a more objective position, has a much better chance of actually building common understanding around the moral issue at hand.</p>\n</blockquote>\n", "parentCommentId": "2bNC7M8DofpajCZ7F", "user": {"username": "Kaj_Sotala"}}, {"_id": "42638vNDWYfC37j27", "postedAt": "2017-06-11T18:12:57.167Z", "postId": "WdMnmmqqiP5zCtSfv", "htmlBody": "<p>Hi Kaj,</p>\n<p>Even if we found the most agreeable available set of moral principles, that amount may turn out not to constitute the vast majority of people.

The PhilPapers survey didn't show any of the three major ethical schools (consequentialism, deontology, virtue ethics) being significantly more favored by professional philosophers than the others, nor does anyone - to my knowledge - even know what a decisive theoretical argument in favor of one of them could be.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Restricting analysis to the Western tradition, 2500 years ago we barely had any conception of virtue ethics. Our contemporary conceptions of virtue ethics are much better than the ones the Greeks had. Meanwhile, deontological and consequentialist ethics did not even exist back then. Even over recent decades there has been progress in these positions. And plenty of philosophers know what a decisive theoretical argument could be: either they purport to have identified such arguments, or they think it would be an argument that showed the theory to be well supported by intuitions, reason, or some other evidence, not generally different from what an argument for a non-moral philosophical theory would look like.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>it's noteworthy that at their current state, none of the existing ethical theories are up to the task of giving us such a set of principles that, when programmed into an AI, would actually give results that could be considered &quot;good&quot;. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It would (arguably) give results that people wouldn't like, but assuming that the moral theory is correct and the machine understands it, almost necessarily it would do morally correct things. If you object to its actions then you are already begging the question by asserting that we ought to be focused on building a machine that will do things that we like regardless of whether they are moral. Moreover, you could tell a similar story for any values that people have. Whether you source them from real philosophy or from layman ethics wouldn't change the problems of optimization and systematization.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And at this point, we have pretty good theoretical reasons for believing that the traditional goal of moral philosophy - &quot;developing a set of explicit principles for telling us what is good&quot; - is in fact impossible.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>But that's an even stronger claim than the one that moral philosophy hasn't progressed towards such a goal. What reasons are there?</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Or at least, it's impossible to develop a set of principles that would be simple and clear enough to write down in human-understandable form and which would give us clear answers to every situation, because morality is too complicated for that.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That's contentious, but some philosophers believe that, and there are philosophies which adhere to that. The problem of figuring out how to make a machine behave morally according to those premises is still a philosophical one, just one based on other ideas in moral philosophy besides explicit rule-based ones.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Yes, I am here assuming &quot;what is good&quot; to equate to &quot;what do human brains consider good&quot;, in a way that may be seen as reducing to &quot;what would human brains accept as a persuasive argument for what is good&quot;. You could argue that this is flawed, because it's getting dangerously close to defining &quot;good&quot; by social consensus. But then again, the way the field of ethics itself proceeds is basically the same: a philosopher presents an argument for what is good, another attacks it, if the argument survives attacks and is compelling then it is eventually accepted.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Except the field of ethics does it with actual arguments among experts in the field. You could make the same story for any field: truths about physics can be determined by social consensus, since that's just what the field of physics is, a physicist presents an experiment or hypothesis, another attacks it, if the hypothesis survives the attacks and is compelling then it is eventually accepted! And so on for all non-moral fields of inquiry as well. I don't see why you think ethics would be special; basically everything can be modeled like this. But that's ridiculous. We don't look at social consensus for all forms of inquiry, because there is a difference between what ordinary people believe and what people believe when they are trained professionals in the subject.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>for moral truths it looks to me unavoidable - due to the is-ought gap - that some degree of &quot;truth by social consensus&quot; is the only way of figuring out what the truth is, even in principle.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Then why don't you believe in morality by social consensus?

If I thought that it was particularly important for me to make sure that this was correct, then I might look up the exact reasoning and experiments used to determine this and try to replicate some of them, until I found myself to also be in consensus with the physics community.</p>\n<p>Similarly, if someone came to me with a theory of what was moral and it turned out that the entire community of moral philosophers had considered this theory and accepted it after extended examination, and I could also not find any objections to that and found the justifications compelling, then I would probably also accept the moral theory.</p>\n<p>But to my knowledge, nobody has presented a conclusive moral theory that would satisfy both me and nearly all moral philosophers and which would say that it was wrong to be an effective altruist - quite the opposite.

You believe this, on the basis of your observation that philosophers give different accounts of ethics. But that doesn't mean that moral philosophers believe it. They just don't think that the fact of disagreement implies that no such account can be given.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It seems obvious to me that physics does indeed proceed by social consensus in the manner you describe.
