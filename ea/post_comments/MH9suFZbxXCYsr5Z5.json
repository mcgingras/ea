Raining on everybody else's warm, fuzzy parade will make you &quot;weird,&quot; and people will be less willing to hear about your alternative causes.

Meaning, one really radical advocate for an idea helps plenty more less radical advocates promote their position in society. People living vegan make vegetarians seem less weird than they would without vegans. People advocating total smoking bans everywhere make people asking for smoking bans indoors seem less weird, People demanding a universal basic income make people lobbying for minimum wages and social security less weird. And so on. So while a radical position might not come through, and while a person holding that position might not be successful from a superficial point of view, the position and the person will actually do good by taking away the weirdness of less radical activists. I argue that this is actually a strong multiplicator, much stronger than lowering ones own weirdness and advocating for the more socially acceptable positions and solutions. I also argue that this is the reason why policy develops through the aforementioned six stages. And I argue that the more maximum-weird people there are, the faster this development will be.

People (especially weird ones) tend to be afraid of social rejection, and setting up a framework for failure (spending too many weirdness points) instead of a framework for success (winning familiarity points) can create a culture of fear/guilt around one's identity. I believe this is why some EAs had a cautious reaction to this article.</p>\n<p>I love connecting with people, and I've found the most effective way to do so is to be vulnerable, instead of conservative. This has psychological and philosophical underpinnings, which I don't have room to expound on here.</p>\n<p>So I propose a different metric: familiarity points. People want to affirm you, just as they want to be affirmed. We are all (including EAs, I've discovered) fundamentally human in how we've figured out how the world works. If you can tap into the basic emotions and thoughts that have brought you to your position, in a way that is familiar to others, then you can share your perspective and gain familiarity points at the same time.</p>\n<p>You can also gain easy familiarity points with something that a lot of people are comfortable with, like talking about sports or movies. These are cheap points and not very valuable, but you can leverage them if you dig a little deeper. If you've both seen Inception, great. But if you can both talk about idiosyncrasies in Christopher Nolan's directing over his past 5 movies, then you're getting more familiarity points. You've found something that you're both weird about, and this gains you FAR more traction than simply \u201cnot scaring them off\u201d. </p>\n<p>Once you have gained enough familiarity points, you can start introducing unfamiliar ideas, but from a much better grounding. \u201cYou know, I was thinking about how Nolan portrays the world's collapse in Interstellar, and I was wondering what existential risks are really a problem, so I started reading material from FHI.\u201d This is the foot-in-the-door technique, but since you already have familiarity points, you've got a warm lead, instead of a cold one (to continue the sales lingo). Or, you can use the door-in-face technique: \u201cspeaking of Interstellar, I have some crazy ideas about AI development.\u201d Because you have familiarity points, your interlocutor wants to hear more \u2013 they consider you a kindred spirit, and thus might have some great new information (you are crazy like me, I want to hear your crazy ideas).</p>\n<p>Of course, it's also important to incorporate expectation-setting and have preexisting constructions for conversation entry and the \u201cclose\u201d.

And it's probably more important to figure out what's true than to persuade people.</li>\n<li>Talking about weirdness points is a very negative perspective that could play on people's fear of social rejection. <a href=\"http://effective-altruism.com/ea/bg/you_have_a_set_amount_of_weirdness_points_spend/1l5\">It's probably better to talk about familiarity points instead</a>.</li>\n<li>Weirdness points just alter how much attention people pay to you, and if you only want a subset of the population to pay attention to you, then you are likely to be prepared to spend more weirdness points. i.e. <a href=\"http://effective-altruism.com/ea/bg/you_have_a_set_amount_of_weirdness_points_spend/1kx\">there's not a fixed amount</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I think each of these is a substantial objection to the thesis of the article and taken together they are pretty damaging. </p>\n<p>I think that they can be tied together to be even stronger though. </p>\n<p>If you're trying to spread a radical intellectual idea, in the beginning, you mostly want to target early adopters who have a lot of pulling power. Think of the Einstein-Russell manifesto against nuclear proliferation, which preceded the antinuclear movement by a couple of decades, or of many other social movements whose intellectual forebears who preceded them. So far, the most valuable contributors to ideas relating to effective altruism are people like Martin Rees, Jaan Tallin, James Martin, Elon Musk. To a substantial extent, they appraise ideas based on their content, rather than on the basis of who is presenting them. As publisher <a href=\"http://edge.org\">John Brockman</a> puts it, &quot;I'm not interested in the average person. Most people have never had an idea and wouldn't recognize one if did.&quot; Or, as Peter Thiel says: &quot;What is something you believe that nearly no one agrees with you on?&quot; For these people, holding some unorthodox ideas is a prerequisite for them to listen to you. So for people who are promoting a radical idea to others who are themselves radical thinkers, trying to be normal is just not going to cut ice.</p>\n<p>Not everyone has to be Will MacAskill or Peter Singer. These two are writing popular books about effective altruism and do lots of TV interviews about these things. They practice talking to the masses so that others can focus on industrial and intellectual leaders, and yet others can focus on researching which charities are the most effective. The problem with this post is that it does not apply to others' roles the same as it applies to MacAskill's and Singer's. But rather, the whole spectrum of jobs are important. Arguably, MacAskill and Singer's roles are less important, because if we can't attract the general public, then we can go to high-net worth individuals. However, if we can't figure out which charities are the most effective, then recruiting is no use at all.</p>\n<p>So even if we convince ourselves that it's more important to do fundamental research and talking to intellectual leaders while avoiding public discourse, it's very hard to stave off our human need for social approval. The bottom line, though, is that people don't need a post to tell them to be more aware of social rejection. Most people couldn't forget about social rejection if they tried. In fact, some of the people who gain the most confidence and passion in making a big change to the world do so because they realise that society's big problems are not going to be fixed by themselves. Take <a href=\"http://mindingourway.com/on-saving-the-world/\">Nate Soares</a> for one reasonably articulate example. This can be because of a realisation that society is pretty selfish or crazy a lot of the time, and so some people are going to have to take on the responsibility of improving it. Instead, trying to get across the idea that society is weird might be a better approach to breeding people with a sense of heroic responsibility for fixing it.</p>\n<p>So altogether, although I agree with the post broadly - that it's valuable to be familiar and normal, I think people already behave as though it is. Instead, we should pay more attention to the fact that effective altruism is quite a radical idea, that it already has some people who are focussed on acting as its public face, and that it might be better for people to focus on feeling responsible for improving the world, or for figuring out how, before becoming so alert to social considerations.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "RyanCarey"}}, {"_id": "gP8fXKbmDrY4jZRCn", "postedAt": "2014-11-28T14:00:30.504Z", "postId": "MH9suFZbxXCYsr5Z5", "htmlBody": "<p>Nice summary Ryan.</p>\n<p>Indeed, I think the biggest challenge in terms of spreading EA is what I call &quot;extended responsibility.&quot; Many people have difficulty taking responsibility for their own lives, let alone their family or community.

To a large extent, I\u2019m referring less to this actual post, and more to weirdness points as a meme, which I think is somewhat less nuanced than the original post. So I might not be maximally charitable in my criticisms, since what I am criticising is the concept as it is often expressed, rather thanas&nbsp; it was originally expressed.</p><p>My concerns are a combination of:</p><ol><li>I think the model is somewhat flawed, especially in domains like hobbies and physical appearance, rather than things like policies and opinions, and that likeability is more messy and complicated</li><li>Even if that weren\u2019t true, I worry that, in practice, people\u2019s attempts to make themselves less weird may in fact make them more weird.</li><li>Finally, regardless of 1 or 2, I think that the psychological costs of worrying about weirdness points can be pretty high relative to the potential benefits, at least for a significant subset of EAs. Additionally, to the extent to which one puts credence in the model being correct, I think it can be hard to avoid these costs once one is familiar with the idea of weirdness points.</li></ol><p>I\u2019m going to focus primarily on point 3, since I think other people have already made points 1 and 2.</p><p>I\u2019m going to talk about my personal experience for a bit, because I think it\u2019s illustrative of one of the ways this can go wrong.</p><p>I encountered the concept of weirdness points as a fairly new EA. To give some context, I have always been a fairly weird person, to some extent for reasons largely outside of my control. I\u2019ve also, for a long time, been afraid of being disliked and ostracised for this, and to some extent internalised the notion of weirdness as Bad. At the point I joined EA, I still was pretty insecure about this, but derived reassurance from being able to say that my actual goals had nothing to do with being liked by people. Then suddenly BAM, this reassurance didn\u2019t really work anymore. Me being weird and people disliking me no longer just affected me, but, to some extent, the EA community at large. So suddenly every weird thing I did actively made the world worse! I don\u2019t really endorse this line of reasoning, and I\u2019m certainly not trying to suggest other people endorse it. But I did find it pretty hard to shake because there might well be *some* grain of truth to it, and was in some sense supported by some interpretations of weirdness points. In any case, I don\u2019t think me thinking along these lines was helpful to either myself or the world, since it mostly just worsened by confidence and wellbeing, and made me more afraid to do anything, which probably, if anything, made me less likeable.</p><p>While some aspects of this are likely particular to me, I do think the meme of weirdness points and related concepts may have similar detrimental effects for other EAs, especially those with a history of poor mental health and confidence issues, which seem to be disproportionately prevalent within the community. The idea that you have a *set* number of weirdness points also seems to me to be potentially particularly harmful (regardless of whether it is true), because this seems to imply that those who already have high baseline weirdness for factors entirely outside of their control, such as neurodivergence, or atypical appearance, have a lot fewer of their weirdness points left over before they do anything at all. I think this can lead to people feeling they have to put even more effort than other people into curating their image and have even less freedom to do weird things (when this curation may be more mentally taxing for this precise group of people). Or worse, that their very presence and visibility is *by itself* harming the EA community.</p><p>The concept of weirdness points clearly has some merit to it, especially for individuals going into policy or something very public-facing. The law of equal and opposite advice applies, and it probably is net helpful for a bunch of people. However, most people already worry about being perceived as weird for normal human reasons, and I think that adding the additional worry that being perceived as weird may cause actual moral harm can be psychologically damaging for a proportion of people, and hamper their efforts to do good.</p><p>On net, I\u2019m not sure whether it is wise as a community to spread the meme of weirdness points to the extent that we have.</p>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "MarkCooper"}}, {"_id": "t8e9MJXd64J3K7hzc", "postedAt": "2021-11-07T18:56:35.916Z", "postId": "MH9suFZbxXCYsr5Z5", "htmlBody": "<p>One thing I dislike about this model is that it seems to compress varying negative judgments into \"this person is weird\".
