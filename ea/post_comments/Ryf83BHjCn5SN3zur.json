Scott talks about a risk of dying from surgery of 0.01 %, which would mean an expected cost of 192 $ (= 1.92*10^6*10^-4). This is 3 orders of magnitude (192/0.199 = 965) more costly than what I should be willing to pay based on the 1st 3 bullets above, even neglecting the moneraty costs of the 4th bullet, and harmful effects of the 5th bullet.</p><p>That being said, I think there would be a strong case for donating a kidney if the following is successful:</p><blockquote><p>My [Scott's] kidney donation \u201cmentor\u201d<a href=\"https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/my-left-kidney#footnote-8-136660465\"><sup>8</sup></a> Ned Brooks is starting a new push - <a href=\"https://www.modifynota.org/\">the <strong>Coalition To Modify NOTA</strong></a> - which proposes a $100,000 refundable tax credit - $10,000 per year for 10 years - for kidney donors.</p></blockquote><p>100 k$ would be enough to outweight the monetary and non-monetary costs of the kidney donations in many circumstances (namely my own). In addition, donating 100 k$ to corporate campaigns for chicken welfare would easily outweight any negative effects on animals from the additional human life linked to the kidney donation. I wonder how much one has to earn in the US to fully benefit from a refundable tax credit of 10 k$/year. If I managed to get 100 k$ for a kidney donation (I am currently in Portugal), I would hopefully convince myself to do it (and donate roughly all gains, but this feels like the easy part).</p>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "vascoamaralgrilo"}}, {"_id": "dq7WCmg6GjnnJhSMT", "postedAt": "2023-10-30T14:57:59.157Z", "postId": "Ryf83BHjCn5SN3zur", "htmlBody": "<p>The 1/660 was for the standard CT screening exam; Scott says he was able to get a non-radioactive (MRI) alternative, so presumably that risk of death is ~irrelevant for people that ask the question.<br><br>Also, while I have no particular opinion on your monetary analysis, it seems orthogonal to the reasons Scott mentioned donating the kidney (&amp; the reason I think it's tempting for a lot of EAs).</p><p>Scott himself calculates that \"...it only costs about $5,000 - $10,000 to produce this many QALYs through bog-standard effective altruist interventions, like buying mosquito nets for malarial regions in Africa.

I do not think this criticism applies so much because I am not refusing to play nice with organ donation. I am just arguing that it is not a robustly good way to increase welfare once one accounts for effects on animals.

I estimated a random human causes <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/ayxasxhHWTvf6r5BF/scale-of-the-welfare-of-various-animal-populations\">12.1</a> times as much suffering to factory-farmed animals as the happiness of human life.

I think one should not lie, but that most people would be happy with me doing it if it was in that context, so I would not worry so much about that.

I would regard pressuring people to donate organs as among the most objectionable sort of abuse &amp; exploitation you could possibly do to another person. I would feel very angry at someone who I knew was doing it. I would feel the urge to use violence against them. I might or might not actually do it, but the urge would be there. If someone else used violence against that person, I'd feel like it was deserved and wouldn't judge the violence-user very harshly (all else being equal).</p>\n<p>The fact that you consider my tone inappropriate suggests that you don't instinctively condemn the idea as strongly as I do. Like, I feel like if I were to say that I would have the urge to use violence against a rapist, fewer people would regard that as inappropriate. I'm not saying this to condemn you. I'm saying that if some action which you hypothetically might do would make other people angry enough to use violence against you, that's generally something you want to know. You shouldn't be critical of someone for telling you ahead of time what to expect. That person is providing something of value to you.</p>\n<p>Keep in mind what I said about the screening. The hospital panel asks people whether anyone is pressuring them to donate. Obviously, the panel does this because if someone were pressuring  the donor, that would be grounds to reject the donation. The medical profession views pressuring donors as unacceptable. This is probably a sign that as individuals, they view it as something deeply wrong and which makes them angry. It is also a sign that it is something that <em>actually happens</em> and that they need to actively guard against it.</p>\n<p>To be clear, I'm not threatening to punch anyone over the internet. But I think that if some conduct would make us angry enough to potentially use violence, there has to be some responsible way to let other people know this fact.
