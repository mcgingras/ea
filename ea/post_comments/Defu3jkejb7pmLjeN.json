He contributed greatly to the early theory of effective altruism and along with Will and I was one of the three founding trustees of the Centre for Effective Altruism.

Though you joined shortly after launch, given all your work on it I think you were essentially a third cofounder of Giving What We Can; you led its research for many years, and helped build vital bridges with GiveWell and later Open Philanthropy. I remember that when you launched Giving What We Can: Rutgers, you organised a talk with I think over 500 people. It must still be one of the most well-attended talks that we\u2019ve ever had within EA, and helped the idea of local groups get off the ground.</p><p>The EA movement wouldn\u2019t have been the same without your service.

Being a trustee for CEA/EV has seemed particularly unenviable to me, even before this year.</p><p>I felt kind of sceptical when we first set up CEA (now EV) about how long we\u2019d manage to make it work. After all, 9 in 10 start ups fail and it seems like quite the handicap to be set up and run by philosophy students. Over the last decade it\u2019s hugely outdone my expectations. Its grown far faster than expected and ended up encompassing so many different activities and projects. That\u2019s made being responsible for all of it seem difficult and alarming to me. I\u2019ve been grateful for all the years you took that on.&nbsp;</p><p>I remember when we were putting together the board thinking that there were few people I\u2019d trust enough to feel excited to have them in control of an organisation I cared so much about. And I remember how confident I was that you were one of them. The advice I got at the time about startups was that the founders very often end up not getting on, because it\u2019s such a high pressure environment. But I\u2019ve continued to trust your judgement more than almost anyone else I know. I still feel confident that whatever is thrown at you, you\u2019ll handle it resolutely and keep your eye on what would help others most.

The qualities you brought and inspired in others as a foundational and highly capable figure in EA are evident in the love that so many people this comment section have for you.&nbsp;</p><p>Can you help me understand why you stepped down from the EV boards in August 2023 because of too many recusals starting in November 2022? Did the amount you could participate in the boards meaningfully change recently? You said this was a good time for you to step down, but from the post, it doesn\u2019t sound like there have been significant changes in your ability to contribute to the board since November 2022.&nbsp;</p><p>It\u2019s very difficult for me to understand why, in the aftermath of a crisis, someone with wide-ranging recusals stemming from the crisis that were preventing them from contributing enough would take 9+ months to step down.&nbsp;</p><p>You did this for both the EV boards, which further compounds the issue.&nbsp;</p><p>Additionally, the point of EA is to do the most good. This has been the most critical time period in EA\u2019s history. The EA community meaningfully contributed to an $8,000,000,000 fraud. In the 10 months since then, we have endured painful scandal after scandal, some exposing important governance and leadership failures. Importantly, governance and leadership failures were a factor in the catastrophic FTX fraud, such as the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.semafor.com/article/11/18/2022/effective-altruism-group-debated-sam-bankman-frieds-ethics-in-2018\"><u>CEA/EV trustees</u></a> - Will MacAskill, Toby Ord, and likely Nick Beckstead for the time period in question (based on the <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20180618200316/https://www.centreforeffectivealtruism.org/team/\">Wayback Machine</a>)<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnreftmau48s587p\"><sup><a href=\"#fntmau48s587p\">[1]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;-&nbsp; and other EA leaders effectively ignoring concerns about the business ethics and risk management of SBF while promoting and helping him.&nbsp;</p><p>With all this and more context than I could possibly get into here, it\u2019s even more difficult for me to understand why you stayed on either, let alone both, of the EV boards for 9+ months after FTX exploded.&nbsp;</p><p>I\u2019m sure one consideration was the challenge of finding new and trustworthy board members for small boards. But if this was the bottleneck, why wasn\u2019t it prioritized and dealt with much earlier? It&nbsp;<i>really</i> shouldn\u2019t take close to a year to replace members with wide-ranging recusals in crisis time. This should have been one of the first problems to solve.&nbsp;</p><p>This is all the more true considering the central role of EV in the EA ecosystem. EA has had serious leadership vacuums in this critical period that have significantly impacted our community and, much more importantly, our attempt to make the world a better place.&nbsp;</p><p>It was noteworthy to me that an EV US board member, Rebecca Kagan,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/pWvsvFLeH9LekGqTt/updates-to-the-effective-ventures-us-board\"><u>resigned</u></a> her position in April of this year due to disagreements with the EV boards\u2019 strategy and approach.
