I generally look up to the people who make it up, and I think they put a lot of thought into their decisions.

There are some types of work where doing it successfully means nobody ever hears about you: we generally don't pays attention to people who prevent bad things because we don't notice the absence of bad things as anything... well, as anything notable.
