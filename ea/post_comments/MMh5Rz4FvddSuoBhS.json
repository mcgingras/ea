I\u2019m really glad to feel that EV is going to continue being in safe hands going forward (both given Rob\u2019s extensive experience and knowing from personal experience how responsible he is).&nbsp;</p><p>Thank you so much for your work on EV. Taking on a hugely complex organisation at a time of such turmoil was always going to be extremely challenging. You really stepped up at a time when many of us were struggling just to continue our usual jobs. And then over the start of 2023 instead of getting a break it felt as if a series of separate things happened to keep making the role more challenging. As a staff member of one of the projects EV houses, it\u2019s been really reassuring to know that someone with such great judgement and who is so ceaselessly dedicated was stewarding things, so that we could get on with our object level work without needing to worry much about the background entity.&nbsp;</p><p>From a personal standpoint, I\u2019m even more grateful for the years we got to work together at 80,000 Hours. I\u2019ve learned a huge amount from you in the various different roles we\u2019ve each had. Most influentially, as my manager you did an really astounding job of helping me actually live up to my values and grow, while ensuring I always felt supported and was working sustainably. I\u2019m very much going to miss being able to rely on your advice and support, and I hate that you\u2019re moving to the other side of the world. I\u2019m glad we\u2019ll be continuing to work on the same mission, even if we won\u2019t be next to each other to do it.&nbsp;</p>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "Michelle_Hutchinson"}}, {"_id": "DWWzi7LDdsJDdMCWP", "postedAt": "2023-10-21T00:41:38.106Z", "postId": "MMh5Rz4FvddSuoBhS", "htmlBody": "<p>Howie \u2013 I suspect you\u2019d rather I don\u2019t write anything, but it feels wrong not to thank you for everything you\u2019ve given to this role and to the organisation over the past year.
