I hope to cover this topic in more depth later.</p>\n<p>I'll go through a couple of key considerations and how to settle them.</p>\n<p>1) Expected earnings</p>\n<p>We have a bunch of unpublished research on this. I think the earnings as a startup founder are considerably higher in expectation (say at least 5x) BUT only if you make it into a top 5 accelerator or similar. More broadly, top accelerators seem to have very strong selection power - almost no-one who's rejected by YC succeeds, but the odds are pretty good if you get in.</p>\n<p>So I think reframe the question as &quot;is it worth me spending a couple of months seeing if I can get into a top accelerator?&quot;.</p>\n<p>That depends on your situation. Do you have a cofounder? Do you have a problem in mind? Other entrepreneurs in the EA community can probably advise you on this.</p>\n<p>Also since the earnings of founding are delayed 5-10 years, they're worth about 50% less.</p>\n<p>2) Career capital</p>\n<p>You'll may improve your technical skills more as a SWE, but as a founder you'll learn more entrepreneurial skills and I think those are more valuable (in particular, within EA, there are loads of SWE, but a real shortage of entrepreneurs).</p>\n<p>It's also better for networking, and you'll have to try out all types of work, making it good for exploration. The greater intensity also means you'll probably push yourself more.</p>\n<p>If you fail as an entrepreneur in the US, I think you can go back to SWE with little or no penalty.</p>\n<p>Overall I'd say the startup path is better for career capital, though there are counterpoints:\n<a href=\"http://philosophyforprogrammers.blogspot.com/2014/09/if-you-want-to-start-startup-go-work.html\">http://philosophyforprogrammers.blogspot.com/2014/09/if-you-want-to-start-startup-go-work.html</a></p>\n<p>3) Lifestyle</p>\n<p>Being a startup founder is far harder work and far more stressful. Most founders say they went through really high highs and really low lows. Even the most successful startups are often close to failure several times. All startup founders work very long hours. If you can't hack this, then don't do it.</p>\n<p>Startups also take over your life and become your sole focus. If you succeed, you'll be locked in for 5-10 years. If you're unwilling to commit to this one thing for so long, don't do it.</p>\n<p>This means you'll also have little time for side projects.</p>\n<p>4) Direct impact</p>\n<p>Entrepreneurship probably generates more consumer surplus and positive externalities than being a SWE because it's more innovative. It'll depend on the companies though.</p>\n<p>How strong a consideration this is depends on what cost-benefit ratio you put on your donations. If it's around 10, then it's probably important. If it's more like 100-1000, the donations dominate.</p>\n<p>5) Flexibility</p>\n<p>The startup founder path involves more 'lock-in', so if you're highly unsure, lean against.</p>\n<p>6) The right reasons</p>\n<p>In the startup world, people don't recommend starting unless you're extremely driven by the problem you're trying to solve. Going into it because you expect to earn more probably isn't good enough.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://startupclass.samaltman.com/courses/lec01/\">http://startupclass.samaltman.com/courses/lec01/</a></p>\n<p>Conclusion</p>\n<p>Overall, of those 2 options, I'd lean towards encouraging you to experiment with the startup path - try to put something together that you could pitch to an accelerator. </p>\n<p>If you don't have a good idea, try to join an early stage startup instead (especially one via your network that's got top backers). This is also much better for lifestyle, in particular, it's much easier to quit, so you can try several times before hitting on a success.</p>\n<p>Finally, this is a bigger question, but I don't think you should optimise for earning to give. I think you should work towards working at an EA org or potentially exploring other areas neglected by EAs.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": "atfbmePQrsAaoxsjS", "user": {"username": "Benjamin_Todd"}}, {"_id": "oScK6Aa8c7Lwpcen2", "postedAt": "2015-06-20T06:42:26.882Z", "postId": "FPDzJjHo75cGjcZRY", "htmlBody": "<p>And talk a lot to Ben West!</p>\n", "parentCommentId": "TR3MqGFobE4rEsuQD", "user": {"username": "Benjamin_Todd"}}, {"_id": "uWCbRH3kbTygv7iis", "postedAt": "2015-06-20T16:36:16.011Z", "postId": "FPDzJjHo75cGjcZRY", "htmlBody": "<p>80k advice often seems geared to people with quite a particular educational background.

If you're going to excel in arts, but be average at science, it could easily be better to do arts.

I'm looking for ethical job ideas that someone like myself could actually obtain out there in the world. I'm 36, and not in a financial position to return to school, nor do I want to. I'm low income and working a seasonal factory job at the moment. I make about $10,000-12,000 a year (yes, I actually live on that) so donating money is out of the question (I do however donate my time when I can). I had a good laugh when this website suggested I could donate &quot;just&quot; $12,000 a year! That's all there is here folks! lol. I do what I can for the causes I care about such as not driving a car for the environment and being vegan for both the environment and for my personal convictions that enslavement and killing of our fellow beings is morally wrong. I'd love to find a way to increase my income and also do more to help people, animals, and the planet.

But the responsibility for it is spread over tens of millions of people working in the sector, and billions of people using the products. Furthermore, greater availability of energy through fossil fuels is also helping to lift billions out of poverty. This makes it unlikely to be one of the most harmful careers per employee.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The oil industry isn't as bad as coal. Overall, my guess is that marginal oil exploration is harmful, in that we're extracting more than would be socially optimal (if you were to factor in the costs of carbon dioxide), though it's not super harmful. So earning to give in the sector <em>could</em> be permissible, though if you could find an industry that also has positive effects that would be much better. Also this isn't a thoroughly considered view so could easily change.</p>\n<p>Also, if you were just setting out to earn to give, I don't think focusing on petroleum engineering is an especially good strategy because it's very narrow. You might just turn out not to like it. More worrying, if a carbon tax was introduced (which sounds pretty likely in 10-20 years), then the amount of oil that gets extracted will fall significantly, which will especially harm new entrants to the field. Further, if solar prices keep coming down as fast as they have, then solar electricity will soon be cheaper than fossil fuel produced electricity, and that's going to be another massive hit to the industry. \n<a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/comment/ambroseevans_pritchard/10755598/Global-solar-dominance-in-sight-as-science-trumps-fossil-fuels.html\">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/comment/ambroseevans_pritchard/10755598/Global-solar-dominance-in-sight-as-science-trumps-fossil-fuels.html</a></p>\n<p>More generally, you're building career capital that isn't very robust to the future.
